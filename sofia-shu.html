            <p>
              We climb and descend the hills of Potrero Hill in San Francisco -
              in high heels of course! - as we search for Sofia Shu's secluded
              studio. We're mesmerised by Sofia's meditative, spiritual,
              detailed abstract paintings and wall hangings. Sofia serves us a
              delicious vegan latte and talks about growing up walking through
              snow tunnels in Siberia, learning English by tending bar in NYC,
              ending up in the Bay Area, and meeting her sweetheart prince. We
              love her love story and you will, too.

                ><strong>SS</strong>: I grew up in Siberia. In a very small
                town. It's kind of like if you look at Russia and just like poke
                right in the middle, that's where my town was. It's called
                Nefteyugansk. And the first word of that name is "Neft" which
                means 'oil'. They found um—like that oil that they get from the
                ground, not that oil that they press from olives, you know!
                [laughter]. So yeah they found oil, I guess 50 years ago ,and
                they built this small town really quickly.</span

            <p class="p3">
              <span class="s1"
                >So to get to those oil spots, you would have to take a
                helicopter. My mom was the dispatcher, the person who would be
                like, "You go on this helicopter, you do this, ok now time to
                take off,” she would be like controlling them; for 20 years she
                was working. It was really fun for me, I would go to her office
                and she had this machine that pretty much talks to people in
                helicopters and it would just sound like “der-der-der-der-der",
                and she would understand! What they're saying! And she would
                press the button and be like, "Yes, yeah, do this and do that."
                And I'm like, “Mom, how do you understand? I can't hear
                anything!” It's like when you work I guess every day, you,
                really…I don't know how she did it.</span

            <p class="p3">
              <span class="s1"
                ><strong>SV</strong>: Yeah that's so cool, like you learned
                English she learned helicopter! And did you have other family
                around? Did you have a dad?</span
              >
            </p>
            <p class="p3">
              <span class="s1"
                ><strong>SS</strong>: I had a stepfather not for very long I
                guess, until I was like 12. Yeah, I just kind of remember only
                that, like, just having my mom and my younger sister. She's six
                years younger than me. She has a kid and she just takes care of
                him, she's in Moscow. I visited, it was so surreal because you
                leave here and then you fly for so long and then it becomes—the
                sun sets, the sun rises again and you're still flying, it's like
                20... 24 hours, maybe 30, something like that, if you have
                layovers. It can get very long. And then when you get there,
                you’re like, "Did America ever exist?" I dunno, to me in my head
                it was kind of, going through Atlantic Ocean is kind of like
                this border, it's like, [to Jozefien] you had this feeling
                before?</span
              >
            </p>
            <p class="p3">
              <span class="s1"

            <p class="p3">
              <span class="s1"
                ><strong>SS</strong>: And maybe it's because you Facetime your
                family all the time and you're only on the screen and you go and
                you can actually like, <i>hug</i> them, it just feels so weird.
                You open the door and my mom would come towards me like, “Should
                I start crying? Is it real? What's happening?”</span
              >
            </p>

              <span class="s1"
                ><strong>JB</strong>: How was growing up in Siberia? I imagine
                it's really cold there, in winter, so... How... How? How do? I
                can't, I just can't imagine [laughter] how cold it must be, in
                Siberia.</span
              >
            </p>
            <p class="p3">
              <span class="s1"
                ><strong>SS</strong>: Well, see, I grew up there from…I would
                say six months old, so I didn't know anything else. It was nine
                months of snow. So pretty much, I have my birthday in September,
                I would already go through bushes of snow to get my friends to
                my birthday party, invite them. In May it would be like a really
                cool time because everything finally starts melting. And you
                know this is the end of the school and the summer is coming. So
                yeah, it was a lot of snow, sometimes when you're walking to
                school you can't really take a step to the right, to the left,
                because you'll fall in the really deep snow bushes. But because
                there is a—how do you call it—like, a trail, people step on it
                so much it's like harder. But if you step to the right you can
                just fall through and I don't know. It can be really deep!</span

              <span class="s1"
                ><strong>SS</strong>: The snow is crystalised. When you look at
                the snow flakes it's very, it's a very geometric structure of
                water, right? And all of my art—maybe I got it from studying
                architecture for so long, or maybe I got it from being in this
                like frozen world for so long?—all of my art looks like
                snowflakes. It's like structures, coming like mandalas, from the
                centre.</span

            <p class="p3">
              <span class="s1"
                >I loved the evenings because the sun would go down really early
                and the sky was really clear. I could see all the stars, yeah, I
                would just like hang out with friends. I would be a kid but I
                can hang out with my friends when it's dark outside. Yeah. There
                wasn't really much to do outside, you know? Like in California,
                I think people are so lucky to have this weather and just so
                many activities they can do. To me, it was, you would spend a
                lot of time indoors. So I went to art school at the same time
                when I went to regular school. Every day after regular school I
                would go and paint.</span

            <p class="p3">
              <span class="s1"
                >And I don't know if you guys know, in Russia it's like, art is
                not very, you can't really make a profession out of it. You
                can't just be a full time artist and make enough money. Or you
                can't even tell your parents, “I'm gonna be an artist,” they'll
                be like, “No you're gonna be a doctor.” I thought architecture
                would be the best, most creative profession I can choose. I got
                accepted and I studied architecture for six years. Yeah, it was
                really fun because there was a lot of sculpture classes and
                watercolour and drawing and drafting. And I just slowly, from
                architecture I moved to interiors.</span

                >Started my business, had it for five years with my friend. It
                was really fun, just the two of us. I really don't like working
                for someone. I don't like having a boss. If I work for myself,
                say a 12 hour day, I don't feel like I wasted my time! And we
                were very creative, like, "Where do we wanna take this business?
                Should we start a blog about interior design?" You know it was
                like, no one would stop us from pretty much anything.</span

              <span class="s1"
                >And then, it was kind of a crisis in Russia. Not that many
                people were getting design projects done because the economic
                situation wasn't really well. And I thought it was my
                opportunity to just travel and I wanted to learn English,
                everyone is talking about America, so I'm just gonna spend some
                time, go to school. I went to English school in New York. Pretty
                much with just one friend. I didn't know anyone. I didn't speak
                the language. To me it's like a different planet because I had
                to learn everything from the beginning. I was 26, I think, when
                I moved to America. It's like, different food! The way the
                streets are named! It's like everything was so different but
                also so exciting for me.</span

                are kind of the same it gets, your brain gets kind of dull. Or
                something like that. So yeah, New York was really fun. I met so
                many amazing people. Just amazing.<br

                because I didn't have a big family for Christmas Eve. He lived
                in San Francisco at the time and he has family in Florida. But
                he also has a brother in New York... So they pretty much all
                traveled to New York to spend maybe a day with that brother. It
                was raining. They were gonna go to a different bar and but
                because it was raining so much they just stopped by my bar.
                Which is a great, uh... I don't know, it's like... I'm so happy
                that happened, you know! If he would just keep walking to
                another bar I never would have met him.</span

                from that day, that's it. That’s, our love story began! We, he
                kept coming back to New York to see me. And we decided to be
                together. And I didn't want to really move to California because
                I love New York so much. But he told me I should visit and he'll
                show me, um, "Let's take you to the best spots and make you fall
                in love with California." And I did fall in love with California

                ><strong>SS</strong>: Since I finished my architectural school I
                was just focused on my interior design career. Art was more like
                a hobby. No one in Russia was talking about art as a profession.
                And when I moved to New York, that's where I saw for the first
                time that you can actually be an artist. Because I was hanging
                out around Chelsea galleries a lot. I would go to art openings
                and just be in the artist community. And I see a lot of people
                actually create different kinds of art. It doesn't have to be
                just painting. And they just, the striving as artists. And
                people buy their work and, yeah. They really appreciate
                it.</span

            <p class="p3">
              <span class="s1"
                >After a few months I was like, Wow. There's so many artists and
                they actually spend every day in their studios painting, having
                so much fun probably (I hope they are!) and i just bought so
                many art supplies and I brought it all home and started just
                playing with it. I did so many different works. Because I wasn't
                sure what exactly, what do I want to paint? What medium do I
                want to use? So that was a fun time. Like really free, like just
                trying different things.</span
              >

            <p class="p3">
              <span class="s1"
                >I really love this neat work. To me it's really easy to do
                something very precise. The lines are really straight, and I'm
                really into geometric shapes and forms. How they all work
                together. So when you study architecture you study, it's called
                "rhythm", when you look at the building your eyes just feel good
                about it. It's because of all those proportions, and architects
                know how to put it all together. So it looks very harmonious.
                And I guess that just affects my art. Like I can't leave a
                painting if I look at it and there's something missing, and a
                little bit on the corner, I would put a little dot there or
                something so it's balanced. I guess geometry and balance is
                definitely what I got from architecture.</span

                >I carve out some blocks with a blade. And then I just roll
                paint on it and make prints. I think this is so, so much better
                than just buying a print that was done by printer. I think when
                someone buys art it's so cool when an artist actually touched
                it, and did something to that. Some other things I do, I make
                tapestries. I started doing it because my friends were saying
                that my art looks a lot like textile design. I make each
                tapestry myself. I don't really make a drawing on it. So I
                pretty much start from the centre and I go out. And that gives
                it a symmetry so I don't use any rulers or anything like that.
                It's just my eyes and my hands.</span

                all the colours and see where it will take you. All I'm making
                is just something that kind of sucks you in. Don't do anything,
                don't think of anything, just look at the painting.</span

                just recently those projects started finishing up. Everything is
                installed, really final touch-ups, yesterday I did a photoshoot
                with my friend, of something that just <i>I</i> created, you
                know? I didn't really work with any other designers or any other
                force, or another company. It was just my project. And it was my
                first collaboration with this photographer, my friend Mindi
                Kopal. She wants to change her career a little bit. And be more
                creative like, kind of like day-to-day have more creative
                process, like photographing someone's interiors, someone's work,
                staging. So we had a lot of fun. Our first collaboration, on
                March 8th, Women's Day. It was so significant, I think. I think
                it's everywhere that, that women are a little bit repressed.
                Just empowering each other, it helps, just talking about art and
                stuff. It makes me excited. So same with a lot of amazing women,

                lot of light, natural light. I love the location too, because
                it's in the middle of the Mission district and financial
                district and design district and Dog Patch. It's kind of in the
                middle, so I'm hoping to host a lot of events in this space and
                build a really interesting community that will kind of support
                me, but also I'll support them. This space can be turned into
                pretty much anything. Like a gallery, or even a music venue. I
                want my husband to have some shows here too, play music for
                people. And I want to start this women's group. Whether you're
                creative or not. I want to have bi-weekly events where we just
                get together and we paint, or we do some beading work... And I
                think there's a really deep need in everyone's life, for some

                because there'a s lot of development around this neighbourhood
                and a lot of new buildings and I think a lot of young people
                moving in. And they all go to the Mission or the financial

                I also really like how it sounds. Like “shu”… it almost sounds
