                >We find Angela Hennessy standing at a table of shiny metal
                objects at her studio in industrial Oakland. Jozefien calls it
                cozy, but that’s just because she’s a real European. Nothing
                <em>hygge</em> about this bright warehouse space in which a lot
                of hair is transformed into a lot of art. Hennessy talks growing
                up in Humboldt County, riding horses in the summer, Blackness,
                being a hospice doula, and avoids telling us who gave her the
                genuine actual coffin standing in the middle of the room. </span

                Angela, I don't even know how to put it into words to tell you
                this story of how we met a quite lovely young woman after one of
                Angela's talks at Southern Exposure for her show ‘When and Where
                I Enter’, and this woman was lovely, but she kept talking about
                how much she loves Angela, how amazing Angela was and how she
                really wanted Angela to be her mentor. </span

            <p>
              <span style="font-weight: 400"
                >She was a former student of Angela's and she went to all of
                Angela’s events and it started to feel like a little bit, maybe
                this is a little bit stalker-ish or something, just maybe, you
                know, but it turns out that's actually an entirely appropriate
                response to meeting Angela Hennessy. You just become totally
                smitten, because she's just so eminently crush-worthy. She's a
                wonderful, wonderful person, she's very warm, she's very
                welcoming and she's a great artist.</span

              <span style="font-weight: 400"
                ><strong>jb:</strong> yes! So, Angela Hennessy is a multi-media
                artist and her studio is in West Oakland. The topics Angela
                works around our mourning, grieving, blackness and the work she
                makes are mostly made out of human hair. So, the works at
                Southern Exposure that we saw were made out of synthetic and
                human hair and they get like this very fragile look, delicate in
                a way, but also very powerful </span

                and working with this like glossy black enamel is very much for
                me, like, about, sort of calling in that visual experience that

                just talking about death and grief in the studio or in an
                academic environment it would be pretty easy to sort of go off
                in a very abstract kind of theoretical space. That, for me, is a

                that I feel when I’m, you know, sitting at the bedside of
                someone who is dying. It also keeps me, I think, in a fairly
                vulnerable space as well, you know, just understanding the

                just, you know, even more broad than that, just being a human
                being, we basically begin our lives in textile structures or as
                textile structures. The umbilical cord and amniotic sac, we
                start that way and the first sensory experience that we have in
                the womb is touching, sound and it's also believed that touch
                and sound as well are the last senses to go when someone is

                materials that mediates the boundary between the living and the

                sentences and then it quickly became 10, and it was a 1 through
                10, and I was thinking about the Black Panther 10-point plan and
                so, it started out as a 10-point plan about death and grief and
                wanting to bring in this idea of death as the teacher and that

                mourning practice visible, to sort of make the connection
                between mourning practices and materials and bodies and spaces
                and light and, you know, even just taking the title of the
                exhibition, the ‘When and Where I Enter’ is, you know, very much
                about navigating different types of space and grief is certainly

                blond hair pompoms, so there was a piece there, but what I had
                envisioned for that piece was actually a lighting going to hang
                all the way from the ceiling and come down and be sort of a hair

                I had thought that for the closing panel discussion, I thought
                that I would make a standing lamp for that artist talk and that
                we would be having our conversation under a hair lamp and, I had
                been thinking about the lantern laws from the 1700s, the
                requirement for black people to carry lanterns if they were out
                at night, so this idea of lighting the black body. </span

                stores in the East Bay and a few and San Francisco. But, what
                started happening, a couple of the colours that I was using
                changed so I got 2/3 of the way through the rainbow and then the
                third band of colours I couldn't get the colours that I needed
                and so, I had, I’ve had a few moments of total freak out. But,
                then, yeah, I just kept going back and looking for like,
                “Where's the old colour as opposed to this new colour?” and
                trying to explain to them that even though they have the same
                code they were different colours and trying to show these store
                owners these two different colours I used and they were looking

                the third row, one colour is different than the series and the
                other two bands but I think it's probably not noticeable. But,
                yeah, it was a lot of hair, and I kept, even in the whole last
                week before the show and when the installation started, I kept
                on having to go back and buy more hair and I was having this
                experience, it’s, like, okay, this will be the last batch of
                hair that I need, like, I really have plenty and then I would
                turn around and be like: “Where's all that hair I bought?”, and,

                take a shower and get my nails done. So, I leave the gallery and
                I remember turning around and I had this moment where I turned
                around and looked back at the show and was like: ‘Damn, that
                looks pretty good!’, like okay, you know, it's like that
                recognition of it's actually done and I left, I was getting my
                nails done in Oakland, literally falling asleep in the chair at
                the nail salon. The manicurist, she was getting all pissed off
                at me. She’s like: “Angela, you have to wake up!”. And, I was
