              Welcome to ART CRUSH INTERNATIONAL! We take you to visit Mariam
              El-Quessny in the Oakland apartment she shares with her husband
              and two small children. Quessny, originally from Egypt, has lived
              in California for five years and, despite being a graduate of the
              Pratt Institute’s School of Design, only recently begun to call
              herself an artist. She serves us dandelion tea, shows us the
              tightly packed studio corner she has carved out for herself, and
              tells us about ‘Motherhood Illustrated’, in which she transforms
              women’s photographs of gritty, unflattering motherhood experiences
              into lovingly detailed watercolour paintings. We make a fort in
              her kid’s bed.

                consider it poetry, but just writing stories that were really
                important for me to share and I didn't find an outlet in Egypt
                at the time, so, I just decided to start an open mic and had my
                first open mic in 2009, that was pre-revolution, Egyptian
                Revolution, and it just spiralled out of there and we became the

                >: In Egypt, in transition from open mic’ing into designing and
                doing things, it was actually in a very interesting place
                called, ‘Dar Bersabad Sabad A Montoshar’, it’s a potter’s
                community and it’s originally a poor area. A bunch of artist
                came together and set up an art gallery there and my friend has
                a studio there and I would come, I would go work with her. It's
                a, it's very, it's a very interesting space.</span

                that are there are really interesting and multi, multi-class.
                You know how, like, there's racial stuff here, there’s class
                issues in Egypt, so, to have a multi-class complex is kind of a

                most of them don’t go to school or don't continue school, so,

                conversation, but people that I grew up with are very much
                trying to distance themselves from religion. So, they're
                actually trying to represent themselves more as Westerners, so
                you wouldn't actually know the difference, except from the, how
                they look from their skin, but generally people in Egypt are
                very modest, very conservative,… Actually, they look more modest
                than they are, because it's a cultural norm to cover your hair
                and, and younger people tend to just like dress more tight, most
                girls cover their hair even though they wouldn't if they

                actually, of it, because it does represent that conservative
                dark uneducated aspect of religion, but for me it was, it was a

                ‘cause I, if there's one thing I knew I wasn’t going to do, it

                it's very difficult to walk with an identity, and it is
