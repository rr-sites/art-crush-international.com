              Get your boots and your coat, for this Canadian mischief. Join us
              as we desperately seek a quiet space to conduct an interview in
              Toronto’s Museum of Contemporary Art with Palestinian-Canadian
              artist Samar Hejazi. Hejazi is game for anything, which is
              probably why she’s so good at conceptual, installation, and
              sculptural arts. Hejazi is working on a commission that involved
              making a live cast of someone’s face, stitching onto dissolvable
              fabric (and then dissolving it), and making abstract marks for
              literally no reason at all. We are besotted.

                ><strong>jb:</strong> This week we have a crush on a
                Palestinian-Canadian artist who is based in Toronto, Samar
                Hejazi. So Samar makes these textile works, and she also works
                with words. So it's textile combined with words. And she's also
                a sculptor and she makes these beautiful sculptures of the human
                figure, it's not always a complete human figure. She does
                something very beautiful and poetic with it. If you go to her
                Instagram, which is actually just her name, it's Samar,
                S-A-M-A-R Hejazi, H-E-J-A-Z-I, there you can see that lately
                she's been taking a cast of somebody's bust. And you can follow
                the whole process of how that goes. And it looks like a lot of
                work.</span

                ><strong>sh:</strong> I have started working on a sculptural
                piece, it's a commission, based on my sculptures that I made a
                few years ago. So my older pieces have crystals that come out of
                the face or the head or whatever. So she saw a couple of those
                and wanted one of her own head, but with crystals coming out of
                her head. It relates to an experience that she had, a spiritual
                experience. So now I'm in the mould-making phase, so the
                sculpture's covered in silicone and then I'll cover this with
                plaster and then I'll open it up0, take out the clay, and then
                I'll cast it in plaster. And that's when I'll start playing
                around with the crystals, and breaking the piece and you know,
                sculpting. I did so much research to review my mold-making
                skills, I could write a PhD paper by the end of it. Like, "OK,
                go do it now, just go do it now!"</span

                like 3 hours. And 3 hours with your mouth closed and your eyes
                closed, is fine when you have the silicone maybe, but when we
                started putting the plaster bandages on her head, it was heavy,
                you don't know what's going on, you can't talk, it's
                claustrophobic, you can't breathe that well, other than through

                she does a lot of meditation, a lot of that kind of stuff, so
                she was OK. So yeah, so now my studio looks like a sculpting

                I think most of my work is about layers of identity and how I

                Palestinian. My grandmother runs a Palestinian heritage centre
                in Jordan. So we always had embroidery around us, traditional
                embroidery and very traditional things, always. Women's crafts

                concept a little further. And then I went to Palestine and
                Jordan and then after that I started working with textiles. So,

                don't think she's ever explored the idea of being an artist.
                That just wasn't an option. She's more entrepreneurial as
                opposed to businessy, and I think my work is very conceptual. So
                for a lot of them it's like, "Why did you do that? It's so nice
                without you doing that." I have a piece, I did the embroidery
                and then I cut the embroidery so it's like fluffy and to them
                it's ruined. But to me it symbolises the abstraction of
                tradition. And it talks about how now culture and tradition is
                being used as a way to lure people in, as a novelty, for
                tourism. But the truth of the traditions and the cultures and
                the rituals aren't explored as deeply as they used to be. So
                it's just an abstraction of what these things used to be.</span

                dissolved it at the studio and all the things that I sewed held
                together because they were connected. And so it's

                loss of land and all of that. And my grandmother used to sing it
                to us. So I wrote it out in this English-Arabic. When Arabs that
                are living in the West communicate with Arabs in the East,
                they'll use the Latin alphabet. So for the sounds that the

                up. And not all the keyboards had an Arabic option and
                everything was in English but we were still trying to speak in
                Arabic sometimes. And so, I thought that was a pretty amazing
                phenomenon. And I was surprised, nobody talks about it! I mean,
                even the Arabs don't talk about it. It's part of an identity
