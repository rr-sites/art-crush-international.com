We fall in love with her capacity to turn plastic toy bits (don't you have a box of plastic toy bits??) into smooth, multilayered wearable art. She's that genius who can look at a Lion King franchise Happy Meal toy and see the perfect oval pendant hiding within its soul. Svea's four-year-old daughter appreciates all aspects of this experience. Colours are discussed. Also, <em>kardemummabulle</em>!</div><div><div class="gallery-wrapper"><div class="gallery" data-is-empty="false" data-columns="2"><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://artcrushinternational.com/media/posts/24/gallery/HJL-10-2.jpg" data-size="2417x2280"><img loading="lazy" src="https://artcrushinternational.com/media/posts/24/gallery/HJL-10-2-thumbnail.jpg" alt="" width="768" height="724"></a><figcaption>Helena &amp; Evla in the art studio</figcaption></figure><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://artcrushinternational.com/media/posts/24/gallery/HJL-11-2.jpg" data-size="2420x2335"><img loading="lazy" src="https://artcrushinternational.com/media/posts/24/gallery/HJL-11-2-thumbnail.jpg" alt="" width="768" height="741"></a><figcaption>Evla with one of Helena's art pieces</figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div><div class="gallery-wrapper"><div class="gallery" data-is-empty="false" data-columns="3"><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://artcrushinternational.com/media/posts/24/gallery/HJL-3.jpg" data-size="2245x2387"><img loading="lazy" src="https://artcrushinternational.com/media/posts/24/gallery/HJL-3-thumbnail.jpg" alt="" width="768" height="817"></a></figure><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://artcrushinternational.com/media/posts/24/gallery/HJL-1.jpg" data-size="2592x2443"><img loading="lazy" src="https://artcrushinternational.com/media/posts/24/gallery/HJL-1-thumbnail.jpg" alt="" width="768" height="724"></a></figure><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://artcrushinternational.com/media/posts/24/gallery/HJL-9.jpg" data-size="2417x2442"><img loading="lazy" src="https://artcrushinternational.com/media/posts/24/gallery/HJL-9-thumbnail.jpg" alt="" width="768" height="776"></a></figure><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://artcrushinternational.com/media/posts/24/gallery/HJL-6-2.jpg" data-size="2131x2133"><img loading="lazy" src="https://artcrushinternational.com/media/posts/24/gallery/HJL-6-2-thumbnail.jpg" alt="" width="768" height="769"></a></figure><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://artcrushinternational.com/media/posts/24/gallery/HJL-8.jpg" data-size="2446x2426"><img loading="lazy" src="https://artcrushinternational.com/media/posts/24/gallery/HJL-8-thumbnail.jpg" alt="" width="768" height="762"></a><figcaption>Studio pictures</figcaption></figure><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://artcrushinternational.com/media/posts/24/gallery/HJL-7.jpg" data-size="2385x2208"><img loading="lazy" src="https://artcrushinternational.com/media/posts/24/gallery/HJL-7-thumbnail.jpg" alt="" width="768" height="711"></a></figure></div></div></div><div>Helena on Instragram: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/helenajohanssonlindell/">https://www.instagram.com/helenajohanssonlindell/</a> </div><div>Helena online: <a href="http://www.helenajohanssonlindell.com/">http://www.helenajohanssonlindell.com/</a> </div><div> </div><div>Beautiful Online Thing: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/slow_roads/">SLOW ROADS</a> on Instagram</div><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="400px" height="102px" src="https://anchor.fm/art-crush-international/embed/episodes/Why-Helena-Johansson-Lindell-Wants-Your-Garbage-ev93aj" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><h2 class="align-center">Transcription of Helena Johansson Lindell's interview</h2><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">SV: Svea Vikander</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">EB-V: Evla Boyda-Vikander</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">HJL: Helena Johansson Lindell</span></p><p class="p2">__</p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>Voiceovers in italics.</i></span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">SV: <i>Helena Johansson Lindell is a jeweller I met when she had a show at Velvet Da Vinci, the now-closed fine art and jewellery gallery on Polk Street in San Francisco.

Did you want milk in your coffee?</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">SV: Yes, yeah.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">SV: <i>and she agreed to show me her studio and talk about her practice.

Do you live here? How does this work?!</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">HJL: Eight people are here now, or nine actually, but then most, most of us have holiday now.

Her studio is in Södermalm, which is an artsy part of town with small businesses, immigrants, excellent thrift stores with none of the dirt and cat hair you find in American thrift stores, and consignment shops that sell vintage children’s shoes for almost nothing. Paradise, basically.</i></span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">EB-V: I'm wearing really pretty shoes.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">SV: Oh, would you like to show Helena your new shoes?</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">HJL: Oh please do</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">SV: Yeah we just got these at the consignment store.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">HJL: Ooh.

But I hate black.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">SV: Why?</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">EB-V: It interrupts my colours.

With the painting?</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">EB-V: Yeah</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">SV: Yeah, black is so, very bossy.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">HJL: Yes!</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">SV: Cuz you know you just add a little bit and it takes over the whole thing.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">HJL: Exactly. Is that something you, do you call it a bossy colour, or is that a saying? Cuz I've never heard that.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">SV: It's just me</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">HJL: Because I never heard that but it's so good. It is a bossy colour!

I have so many materials and so many things. And then, the pieces grow also. They started growing when I moved here but now I need a space where they can grow even bigger.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">SV: OK. Shall we go take a look at some of Helena's work?</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">EB-V: Yeah</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">SV: OK, can you show us some..?</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">HJL: Sure</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">[sounds of getting up]</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">SV: Can we leave our bags here?</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">HJL: Yeh</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">SV: Oooh ooh!

That's just the patriarchy.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">HJL: Thank you. [laughter] That's a good way to end.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">SV: "*bleep* the patriarchy.

So nice to have you here. Hej då!</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">[street sounds]</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">SV: I'm just gonna say my reflections. Helena seems super happy and healthy and uh, she's on summer vacation but she came in just for us. And she needs a new and bigger studio. So I hope the next time we see her she has a new and bigger studio.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">EB-V: But um, can I, can I [microphone moves closer to her] What I like about her is because her has so much pretty things and also pink things and also that her has so many necklaces and beads. And I also like that her has so much art. And all those things.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">SV: OK.
