              We’re on our way to Belgium! Come eat quesadillas in Tramaine de
              Senna’s studio with us. She’s a mixed media artist with a
              background in architecture, proudly from Vallejo, California.
              Nowadays, she loves the light and space in the Antwerp studio she
              shares with her husband. It has a band saw and a paint dryer and a
              sewing machine and a huge jar of beads that’s great for looking
              at. De Senna talks love, absurdity, and the migration of forms. We
              can’t bring ourselves to leave.

              wonderful places with lots of light, beautiful artworks, comfy
              chairs, and lots more. Svea, where are we going?
            </div>
            <div> </div>
            <div><strong>sv:</strong> Today we're going to Antwerp</div>
            <div> </div>
            <div><strong>jb:</strong> In Belgium!</div>
            <div> </div>
            <div>
              <strong>sv:</strong> That's right. Have you heard of this place
              called Belgium?
            </div>
            <div> </div>
            <div>
              <strong>jb:</strong> Uh, yes. I have heard of the place called
              Belgium because I'm Belgian, I was born there, I grew up there.
            </div>
            <div> </div>
            <div>
              <strong>sv:</strong> Yeah it's a really nice place you should go
              there sometime. But today we are going to visit the studio of
              Tramaine de Senna
            </div>
            <div> </div>
            <div>
              <strong>jb:</strong> That's so exciting, can you tell us a bit
              more?
            </div>
            <div> </div>
            <div>
              <strong>sv:</strong> Tramaine, Tramaine de Senna is your friend,
            </div>
            <div> </div>
            <div>
              <strong>jb:</strong> It's my friend, it's true, but you can
              introduce her!
            </div>
            <div> </div>
            <div>
              <strong>sv:</strong> I'll talk about her, yeah. So your friend
              Tramaine de Senna, who lives in your country, Belgium, also has
              roots in the Bay Area and she's a visual artist. She does
              sculpture and textile work. And you can find her on Instagram at
              @tramainedesenna. [spells out] And yeah, she's really wonderful
              and she has a studio in Antwerp and she can also talk about her
              experiences in the Bay Area as well. So we're gonna get a really
              interesting compare and contrast today.
            </div>
            <div> </div>
            <div>
              <strong>jb:</strong> I've been really looking forward to doing
              this interview with Tramaine so, we'll have a blast.
            </div>
            <div> </div>
            <div><strong>sv:</strong> That's right</div>
            <div> </div>
            <div><strong>jb:</strong> Ok</div>
            <div> </div>
            <div><strong>sv:</strong> The ceiling can't hold us</div>
            <div> </div>
            <div>
              <strong>jb:</strong> No, they can't, they can't. Shall we hop on a
              plane, to see Tramaine?
            </div>
            <div> </div>
            <div><strong>sv:</strong> Let's go!</div>
            <div> </div>
            <div>
              <strong>tds:</strong> I'm Tramaine de Senna, an artist living in
              Antwerp, Belgium. But I'm proudly from Vallejo California.
            </div>
            <div> </div>
            <div>
              <strong>jb:</strong> I drive the car to Tramaine's studio, which
              is located in Deurne, one of Antwerp's suburbs. Even though I only
              need to drive for 35 km, it takes me almost 2 hours to get there.
              As everyone in Belgium knows, Antwerp has a huge traffic problem.
              So I should have seen this coming. I park the car in the parking
              lot and go look for Tramaine.
            </div>
            <div> </div>
            <div>
              There are a few studio spaces on the property, as well as a beer
              cellar. Two employees are standing outside the shop looking at me
              suspiciously. I can see them thinking Who is this woman and why oh
              why is she carrying around a huge old fashioned cell phone with a
              fluffy hat. Note: the old fashioned cell phone? That's my
              recorder. And the fluffy thing on top? That's the windshield. So I
              don't catch loud windy noises when recording outside.
            </div>
            <div> </div>
            <div>
              I feel like I'm being watched so I smile, nod to say hello and
              keep on looking. When I can't find the entrance to Tramaine's
              studio, I give her a call.
            </div>
            <div> </div>
            <div><strong>tds:</strong> (over the phone): this is Tramaine!</div>
            <div> </div>
            <div>
              <strong>jb:</strong> Hi Tramaine, this is Jozefien. Um, I'm here.
            </div>
            <div> </div>
            <div>
              <strong>tds:</strong> Hi, I'm gonna come right down and find ya.
            </div>
            <div> </div>
            <div><strong>jb:</strong> OK perfect, see you soon!</div>
            <div> </div>
            <div><strong>jb:</strong> Oh, hi hi!</div>
            <div> </div>
            <div><strong>tds:</strong> Where'd you park?</div>
            <div> </div>
            <div><strong>jb:</strong> Oh right there, is that alright?</div>
            <div> </div>
            <div><strong>tds:</strong> Yeah yeah yeah, nice to see you!</div>
            <div> </div>
            <div><strong>jb:</strong> Oh yeah, nice to see you again, too.</div>
            <div>
              We walk up the stairs to the first floor and enter Tramaine's
              spacious studio on the right.
            </div>
            <div>wow, my god this is a big space.</div>
            <div> </div>
            <div>
              <strong>tds:</strong> I think we're lucky. Because I don't think
              all the spaces have this kind of light, ceiling.
            </div>
            <div> </div>
            <div>
              <strong>jb:</strong> Oh yeah yeah yeah, yeah that's good. How do
              you call it in English? Lichtkoepels?
            </div>
            <div> </div>
            <div>
              <strong>tds:</strong> Skylight! I'll show you what we have.
            </div>
            <div> </div>
            <div>
              <strong>jb:</strong> Before we drive into our studio tour,
              Tramaine offers to cook us delicious quesadillas because it's
              already after lunch time.
            </div>
            <div>
              You're so sweet. I'm here to interview you and I'm getting food
              instead.
            </div>
            <div> </div>
            <div>
              <strong>tds:</strong> But isn't that what artist studios are like,
            </div>
            <div> </div>
            <div>
              <strong>jb:</strong> consequently, we cozily chat our way through
              the afternoon and almost forget we have an interview to do! Let's
              get to work!
            </div>
            <div>
              Well mostly we start at around 10 and then it's finished around
              noon.
            </div>
            <div> </div>
            <div>
              <strong>tds:</strong> Oh my. You can start, I'm just gonna like
              cook these while I'm...
            </div>
            <div> </div>
            <div><strong>jb:</strong> No, that's alright.</div>
            <div> </div>
            <div>[music]</div>
            <div> </div>
            <div><strong>tds:</strong> This is the studio,</div>
            <div> </div>
            <div><strong>jb:</strong> yay!</div>
            <div> </div>
            <div><strong>tds:</strong> Thanks for coming</div>
            <div> </div>
            <div><strong>jb:</strong> sure, thanks for showing me around</div>
            <div> </div>
            <div>
              <strong>tds:</strong> Yeah you're welcome Like, I have a lot of
              art stored against the wall here
            </div>
            <div> </div>
            <div>
              <strong>jb:</strong> we're looking [duck down more] at some
              wrapped artworks on the right when entering Tramaine's studio
            </div>
            <div> </div>
            <div>
              <strong>tds:</strong> very large sculptures, large wooden panels
              and frames from other artworks. I think we're gonna throw away
              some stuff.
            </div>
            <div> </div>
            <div><strong>jb:</strong> Oh, really</div>
            <div> </div>
            <div>
              <strong>tds:</strong> Yeah, and there's also paintings from other
              people, too. So that's nice.
            </div>
            <div> </div>
            <div>
              <strong>jb:</strong> Moving forward, we arrive at the first of
              many of Tramaine's work stations.
            </div>
            <div><strong> </strong></div>
            <div>
              <strong>tds:</strong> tools and a machine for drying paint which
              is pretty handy and a—
            </div>
            <div> </div>
            <div><strong>jb:</strong> Which one?</div>
            <div><strong> </strong></div>
            <div>
              <strong>tds:</strong> This one, it's pretty handy, yeah yeah, it's
              great. It's something that you need for a studio but if you're at
              home it would eat up your electricity, you know? It's very
              practical. That's a band saw and I remember at Berkeley when I was
              there, there was a picture of a bloody finger detached with a
              little string in between it, like some kind of organ because it
              was like, "Do not,—watch your fingers."
            </div>
            <div> </div>
            <div><strong>jb:</strong> Important</div>
            <div> </div>
            <div>
              <strong>tds:</strong> Yeah very much so. So that thing can take
              stuff off. So, next to the tool box just like a large work table
              with a lot of junk on it right now.
            </div>
            <div> </div>
            <div><strong>jb:</strong> So this is the spot where you work?</div>
            <div> </div>
            <div>
              <strong>tds:</strong> actually I work across from it, I have more
              tables
            </div>
            <div> </div>
            <div><strong>jb:</strong> Oh wow wow wow</div>
            <div> </div>
            <div>
              <strong>tds:</strong> yeah, different media. So this is like,
              crushing things or painting stuff. This table, taking things
              apart, yeah you see a whole bike chain. I gotta clean it up. Yeah.
            </div>
            <div> </div>
            <div>[music]</div>
            <div> </div>
            <div>
              <strong>tds:</strong> But also a small kitchenette because when
              you're working for a while or if you need to make glue out of
              flour salt and water, it's handy to have a hot plate. The studio
              came with the refrigerator and microwave too, so it's a pretty
              handy thing when you wanna put in long hours, it's nice to feel
              comfy actually. So yeah that's what you see and next to all of
              that is plenty of book supplies, just tools.
            </div>
            <div> </div>
            <div><strong>jb:</strong> Yeah, it looks very organized.</div>
            <div> </div>
            <div>
              <strong>tds:</strong> Yes! You know you need a little bit of
              organization so you can cut loose with making art.
            </div>
            <div> </div>
            <div>
              <strong>jb:</strong> Do you wanna show your other work table?
            </div>
            <div> </div>
            <div>
              <strong>tds:</strong> Yes, so a little turn, this is another table
              that I use for fabrics, fabric work , sewing, maybe painting small
              objects. It's like a dry table. And it has cardboard on it right
              now because cardboard is really great, accessible, I can find it
              on the street but it's just a really great surface to work on if
              it's clean. So I'll just put out a cloth and then I'll do ironing
              and stuff, for working with fabrics that cannot get dirty. It's
              always this spot. This spot is always a very clean spot, you can
              make objects and keep it kind of pristine.
            </div>
            <div> </div>
            <div>
              <strong>jb:</strong> And there's a huge jar with colourful beads.
            </div>
            <div> </div>
            <div>
              <strong>tds:</strong> Yes, yeah, um, it's great to look at. I
              haven't incorporated it in my art yet. Oh wait actually I made a
              little art piece on the wall with some of these rhinestones but
              um, I really enjoy some of these colour combinations because they
              remind me of toys from when I was a kid. Barbie and the Rockers,
              Barbie had her own rock group...
            </div>
            <div> </div>
            <div>
              When I look at her clothing or her tools, little guitars and
              stuff, they had really great colour texture fabric combinations.
              For instance like a neon green with a magenta and maybe some
              yellow in there. So with some of these rhinestones I bought them
              just to have fun with it, and can I show you over here?
            </div>
            <div> </div>
            <div>
              <strong>jb:</strong> Tramaine takes me to another work station on
              our left to show me one of her artworks.
            </div>
            <div> </div>
            <div>
              <strong>tds:</strong> So I made this 3D card. There's actually a
              second one out there that I gave to my lawyer. But I use the
              rhinestones to accentuate this card which is Jambie the Genie and
              Jambie is a character on Pee Wee's playhouse, a great TV show for
              children which came out in 1987 and it went until 1991 but um I
              love the character Genie because it's the only character on the
              show which is not an animal come to life or a piece of furniture
              that has come to life.
            </div>
            <div> </div>
            <div>
              It's its own thing, something supernatural. And it's really great
              to think of this thing, this entity that allows you to make wishes
              and maybe they can come true. The whole show is imaginative and
              creative. But this one character is just -- it kind of looks
              creepy, the card I made, the rhinestones but it's also a little
              surprising reminder.
            </div>
            <div> </div>
            <div>
              <strong>jb:</strong> and it's very sweet. and the head turns
              around
            </div>
            <div> </div>
            <div>
              <strong>tds:</strong> yeah the head can turn but maybe one day I
              can make it into a brooch somehow. But yeah, that's jambie's head
              because it's a head in a box and when you say something like
              'wish' the box opens and then he starts talking.
            </div>
            <div> </div>
            <div><strong>jb:</strong> And there is also this golden shelf</div>
            <div> </div>
            <div><strong>tds:</strong> The golden shelf?</div>
            <div> </div>
            <div>
              <strong>jb:</strong> No, the golden shell, the golden shell
            </div>
            <div> </div>
            <div>
              <strong>tds:</strong> The golden shell, yes, a girl friend of mine
              who's also an artist, a painter, gave this to me at the opening of
              the last show I had, "Supernatural" in Antwerp. She got it at a
              vending machine, it had a toy in it but I guess she gave it to me
              because the chair objects I made for the show reminder her of this
              scallop!
            </div>
            <div> </div>
            <div><strong>jb:</strong> Oh, I can see that</div>
            <div> </div>
            <div>
              <strong>tds:</strong> Yeah yeah, I love it actually I love
              scallops because it's like the little mermaid—Ok, all these things
              going back to toys, I'm revealing all my influences but that's
              okay.
            </div>
            <div> </div>
            <div><strong>jb:</strong> Toys, that's important</div>
            <div> </div>
            <div><strong>tds:</strong> yeah yeah</div>
            <div> </div>
            <div>
              <strong>jb:</strong> Oh and this, there's another desk in the
              corner?
            </div>
            <div> </div>
            <div>
              <strong>tds:</strong> Yeah, there's a lot. But which one should I
              tell you about? Like this is the boring one, that's the exciting
              one.
            </div>
            <div> </div>
            <div><strong>jb:</strong> Let's go to the exciting one.</div>
            <div> </div>
            <div>
              On the wall in front of us, hangs Tramaine's collection of
              photographs that serve as her inspiration
            </div>
            <div> </div>
            <div>
              <strong>tds:</strong> I'm sure everyone collects images, or things
              that intrigue them somehow. I remember doing that in high school
              but also at Berkeley in my architecture studio but even now I
              still collect images. I hang them up above the wall to think about
              stuff. And they actually influence me to make objects.
            </div>
            <div> </div>
            <div>
              But what I find, I would like to transfer the aura that these
              images have into an object. And that's, that's kind of like the
              first parts of making art for me. So yeah, it's uh, I just collect
              theses things that alternate between civilization, these monuments
              of civilizations and also home decor, or cozy things, or movie
              sets, or objects or toys.
            </div>
            <div> </div>
            <div><strong>jb:</strong> It's nice!</div>
            <div> </div>
            <div><strong>tds:</strong> Thank you.</div>
            <div> </div>
            <div><strong>jb:</strong> Do the pictures change over time?</div>
            <div> </div>
            <div>
              <strong>tds:</strong> Some pictures I add to and some I take out
              but then some I keep with me for a long time. Also, images from
              the Wizard of Oz I've been keeping with me for the past 8 years
              also. Because my father likes that film, it's an influence for
              people but also just aesthetic-wise, it's beautiful, it's
              monumental, it's made in the late '30s, and the character Dorothy
              going on a journey, which people can relate to, going on a journey
              whether it's physical or not.
            </div>
            <div> </div>
            <div>
              But her being surrounded by these three characters -- these male
              characters -- but they're actually symbolically different facets
              of her, you know? But in order to show a multiplicity of being the
              storyteller shows it in different characters. So I really like the
              idea of a journey somehow and the mystery within people.
            </div>
            <div> </div>
            <div>
              And then, yeah, new images come in. But roughly throughout the
              years, I've paid attention to my archives and they just basically
              stay the same. And they're images that either I've taken or that
              I've found, took photos of, or things that I've found online too.
              It comes, they come back to life. Where they're being reprinted
              again or scanned, or printed again, or living in my computer. And
              then again, we have some toys here also
            </div>
            <div> </div>
            <div><strong>jb:</strong> Oh yeah, here he is, right?</div>
            <div> </div>
            <div>
              <strong>tds:</strong> Isn't that amazing? Because my auntie,
              whenever my sister and I would visit her house with my uncle, she
              had all these tchotchkes in her cabinet and one of them, she would
              have all these toys from PeeWee's playhouse and you couldn't touch
              them but you could look at em, so it was like amazing, I'm sure
              when I go to see her she will still have those toys and I'll stare
              at them.
            </div>
            <div> </div>
            <div>
              <strong>jb:</strong> Now that the studio tour is done, we set up
              at the kitchen table to continue our interview.
            </div>
            <div>What do you like about the studio space you're in now?</div>
            <div> </div>
            <div>
              <strong>tds:</strong> Oh my gosh what do I like about it? I love
              the fact that there is light coming in from the ceiling and you
              and I were talking about that. Like um, skylights? But I forgot
              how you say that in Netherlands?
            </div>
            <div> </div>
            <div><strong>jb:</strong> Lichtkoepels </div>
            <div> </div>
            <div>
              <strong>tds:</strong> [repeats] That's what i love about it. And
              I've always wanted that, in the back of my mind wherever I've
              gone. I've always wanted to have really great natural light
              somehow. So I am very lucky to have this studio with
              <em>lichtkoepels</em> in the ceiling. So I like that and I like
              the fact that there are other people here, in this building. Other
              artists as well.
            </div>
            <div> </div>
            <div>
              When I open the windows I can hear them, which is cool. But also
              when I open the windows there are all these, there are many
              rooftops that I can see. And it's kind of like in the back lot of
              the streets so you have—it's funny how things are set up over here
              in Belgium. You have the facade of houses and the entrance way of
              houses and stuff. But when you look closely between spaces you can
              see that there might be interior courtyards. Or maybe in this
              courtyard there's a supermarket.
            </div>
            <div> </div>
            <div>
              But in this case there's also this back story of how people live.
              You see the interiors of people's houses. Not here but in other
              spaces. But one of these days what I'd like to do when I open
              these windows is to actually build a physical bridge -- it's a
              maybe 6 foot span to the next rooftop. And my neighbours can
              easily go onto these rooftops but for me there is corrugated clear
              roofing that shows what is underneath, which is like a beer
              cellar. So there is no way that I can climb onto this roof and
              jump onto the other roof.
            </div>
            <div> </div>
            <div>
              Then when I don't make art I can sunbathe! In the privacy of not
              many people seeing me, which is great.
            </div>
            <div> </div>
            <div>
              <strong>jb:</strong> If there was one thing you could change about
              the studio, what would it be?
            </div>
            <div> </div>
            <div>
              <strong>tds:</strong> good question! I would raise the roof, like
              uh, make the ceiling higher. Which is impossible because this is
              all poured-in-place concrete. But having high ceilings is so nice,
              it's just a nice feeling. And it's really hard to find. You can
              find it in fancy chic buildings but not in studios so much. But
              when you do it's really great, it's a great feeling.
            </div>
            <div> </div>
            <div><strong>jb:</strong> would you store more?</div>
            <div> </div>
            <div>
              <strong>tds:</strong> [chuckles] Yeah I know, huh. And that
              becomes an excuse to store more crap and art! Yes Josie, thank you
              [laughter], yes I would collect more things to store, yeah yeah.
              Yeah maybe, build higher shelves and store things, I guess. Yeah.
            </div>
            <div> </div>

            <div> </div>
            <div>
              <strong>tds:</strong> The first thing, as a child you start off
              creating things and for me I just enjoyed it and it just stuck.
              And all throughout my schooling my classmates always encouraged me
              and my teachers did too. And my father was always concerned
              because he has this idea that artists always make money when
              they're dead which yeah, it happens! My mom always supported me as
              well.
            </div>
            <div> </div>
            <div>
              My dad was wanting me to be more well-rounded so when I went off
              to college that, you know, it's this kind of immigrant idea that
              you must  work hard, study hard, and go to university to get a
              good job so you can support your family. So I followed through
              with architecture but I also studied art and I went into
              architecture but I always wanted to make art, and I always did,
              but there was one person my dad knew.
            </div>
            <div> </div>
            <div>
              It was the mother of his friend named Nancy, [name]. And she was
              the first person I ever met who was extremely cultured. She passed
              away a few years ago. She would have been maybe 80 now. She
              married a doctor and then eventually, she was also married to a
              lawyer, but she lived in San Francisco on Divisadero, and her
              neighbour below her was former governor Jerry Brown, you know what
              I mean? She was super high class.
            </div>
            <div> </div>
            <div>
              But she, I don't know, she liked my sister and I. She introduced
              us to SF MOMA when we were kids. I mean, I remember she took us
              there and I saw Jeff Koons' Michael Jackson With Bubbles statue,
              and I think it was an exhibition, the main exhibition there was
              about drawings from kids who were abused, sexually abused, and I
              remember seeing her cry. And I never saw Nancy cry or be so
              emotional but that was pretty cool to see someone cry, viewing
              artwork, especially someone like her.
            </div>
            <div> </div>
            <div>
              But she was quite a figure for me. And my mom always gave my
              sister and I play dough and whenever we would visit my mom we were
              always making stuff or sewing things. So it's just always stayed
              and it's just been a path of how to find my way so I can make art.
              You gotta do all these other things, you gotta go to school for
              other stuff and take jobs or whatever. But the main thing is
              always because I need to make art. I need to go this way because I
              have to make art.
            </div>

            <div>
              <strong>jb:</strong> You went to art school from university onward
              or were you also in art school in high school?
            </div>
            <div> </div>
            <div>
              <strong>tds:</strong> In high school we had art classes and stuff
              but I went to the University of California at Berkeley and so I
              did a simultaneous degree, I studied architecture but I was also
              in art. The silly thing was because I was in both programs, I
              couldn't identify with either one and I always thought well, I
              will never be an artist but I'll just make stuff. I didn't know
              how to dream.
            </div>
            <div> </div>
            <div>
              But then afterwards when I got out and got these desk jobs, I
              really wanted to pursue art but I just thought I couldn't because
              there was no way to make a living. I worked for about seven years,
              working in various jobs. And I had enough money saved up to go
              back to school. I wanted to go to art school but I couldn't do it
              in the States because for me it was just a little bit too
              expensive at the time, and I also wanted to get out of the country
              for a bit just to see what was going on outside the Bay Area.
            </div>
            <div> </div>
            <div>
              I was trying to become fluent in German for the longest time, so I
              could go to art school in Germany because I had exposure to
              Germany for a while and I really liked their schooling and the
              people who were there, it just—the price of food and
              transportation and all that stuff was really nice, and kind of
              modest. I was in Berlin in 2009 and I met some Dutch artists. And
              at that time I had finished my job at a magazine and I had applied
              for a residency because I was thinking, "Well why not," you know?
              "I need to try it." So I found a residency in Berlin.
            </div>
            <div> </div>
            <div>
              And I met an artist duo and some of their friends and I thought,
              "OK, they came from the Netherlands. Where is this country? And
              how did it produce such quirky and amazing artists?!" So I decided
              yeah, I should go to the Netherlands for art school and it turns
              out they had programs in English as well. I studied at Sintyos (?)
              this was in Brega (?) in Surtoganbox (?) that's in the South of
              the Netherlands.
            </div>
            <div> </div>
            <div>
              So I got my Master's there and right after I was accepted into an
              art institute in Belgium. In Ghent, the Hogha (?) Institute for
              KjonKunsten (?) Which was actually part of a two year program
              where they actually, they give you a studio and you have access to
              people in the art world, mostly in Belgium, other artists or
              curators, or directors and stuff. So after the [HISL?] I didn't
              know whether to stay in Belgium or to go back to America and I
              actually did go back to America but some stuff happened so for now
              I'm still in Belgium. I'm in Antwerp now.

            <div>
              <strong>jb:</strong> I guess I also wanna ask: how has moving to
              Europe changed y9our art practice? And if so, how did it change
              it?
            </div>
            <div> </div>
            <div>
              <strong>tds:</strong> That's a good question. When I look back at
              my body of work, the work I've produced, it was always kind of
              changing. Because I was trying to experiment with different media
              and usually the thoughts were always the same. But I chose to come
              to Western Europe because I needed that space of reflection
              somehow. Just to not only think about who I am or the country I
              came from, but just space.
            </div>
            <div> </div>
            <div>
              I had this Euro-centric idea when I was in the States that I have
              to go to Western Europe because they must know their stuff. You
              have the Italians with the high renaissance, or the basic
              architecture or art history, or even architecture history classes
              I took at Berkeley always revolved around Western Europe somehow.
              I mean, it did kind of touch up on the Asias and the Middle east,
              and a little bit on Africa, not much about South America at all,
              but it was really Euro-centric.
            </div>
            <div> </div>
            <div>
              So I thought "OK, that must be where I should go. They must know
              better somehow." It's funny because even without trying, when I
              meet people they say, "Ah, your art looks very American or very
              Californian because there's so much colour in it."

            <div>
              And um, how has my art changed? Hmmm it just always continues to
              change. I think if anything, I still, my mind is still in America.
              Even when I was getting critiqued over here, a lot of the issues I
              was trying to examine were American issues. So it was kind of hard
              to get feedback because there aren't many Americans or people from
              the Americas to give me feedback that I needed at times. But also
              that's fine because it's something larger.
            </div>
            <div> </div>
            <div>
              For a while I wanted to examine my own problems or things I was
              wondering about. I examined ti in my art but also after a while,
              it was like, it's kinda. it's boring, I'm not actually interested
              in it because if I were someone else I wouldn't be interested in
              it, if that makes sense. Because everyone has a story, but the
              story doesn't always have to be heard, you know? So sometimes I
              think, "Ah yeah, my story, actually, pshhh, if I was someone else
              I wouldn't wanna hear it."
            </div>
            <div> </div>
            <div>
              What really makes me interested in other humans is how they
              maintain their humanity, how they overcome things. But how they do
              it in their own exuberant way. Because for instance—I'll make it
              quick—there's this guy named CorlaPandit, and he was this
              supposedly really exotic piano player who had televised television
              broadcasts of him playing piano on TV in the '50s, I think. But it
              turns out this guy, CorlaPandit, who had a head wrap and a jewel
              on his forehead, he said he came from somewhere in India, at that
              time, it was accepted in America because like, "Oh this exotic
              guy, who knows where India is?" I mean, people weren't used to it.
            </div>
            <div> </div>
            <div>
              So he introduced to this large audience, mostly homemakers at home
              in the afternoon, he showed them this exotica music. He maintained
              this practice until the passed away. He was even in the Ted Burton
              film Ed Wood. But it turns out CorlaPandit wasn't Indian! He
              totally falsified this. Him and his wife, she was a worker for
              Disney, they made this persona up for him to get jobs. He was
              actually a Black man! Um, somewhere from Missouri or something.
              Roland....Brown or something? Red, reed, Brown?
            </div>
            <div> </div>
            <div>
              He adapted this persona because as a black man in the US, there
              was this thing called the one drop rule: if you had any drop of
              Black blood you would be considered Black, even though you might
              have blond hair and blue eyes, if you have any Black history, then
              you, there could be ways to discriminate against you. So when this
              guy went from Missouri to Hollywood, he could not play as a Black
              man. So he changed his name to like, Juan Rolando, to be a Latino,
              so he can at least join a union and play music and have gigs and
              make money.
            </div>
            <div> </div>
            <div>
              But eventually, him and his wife, they made this persona. And as
              an Indian man, he was able to show his talent. And I think that's
              just like a really amazing story. I mean not only was he talented
              but he found a way to go through a system. And it could also be a
              little bit offensive because yeah, it's offensive to people who
              are Indians. But I think yeah, that's a great story. He went
              through oppression but he found his way around it. So I find these
              stories amazing. So many things inspire me, too. But yeah, being
              in Western Europe, how does it change my artwork? I also learned
              that, for me it was like finding out how do people operate, which
              is the same anywhere. But like, are people funded by the
              government, do they get grants, or are they represented by
              galleries, or do they open their own spaces? Like how do people
              exist as artists. And I was curious because there seemed to be a
              very accessible, quick artist community in the places that I've
              been able to live here. In the Netherlands and in Belgium,
              somehow.
            </div>
            <div> </div>
            <div>
              <strong>jb:</strong> So you found your art community pretty fast?
            </div>
            <div> </div>
            <div>
              <strong>tds:</strong> Well, um, it took a while. But like when you
              know someone and they accept you, you join other communities. Or
              you meet a nice person. A lot of big things that have happened to
              me have been through other women artists or women curators and
              stuff like that. But I guess my point is that for me when I was in
              the States, I dunno, somehow I didn't know, I couldn't understand
              how the art world worked.
            </div>
            <div> </div>
            <div>
              The art world isn't just like the commercial, capitalistic side.
              There's all these other things, too. But I didn't know how it
              operated, I didn't know who did it or how it ran, or how museums
              ran, you know, if you show your stuff there, they're not
              responsible for sales and all that stuff. So just going over to
              Western Europe it was just really quick for me to like—OK, yeah,
              some artists are really great at selling themselves and they can
              live that way. But it's a small percentage. You have to earn a lot
              of money and half of it goes to taxes. So how do other artists do
              it? Some of them become teachers. But it's, it's everywhere and
              stuff. But it seemed more accessible. Like, I could find out
              quicker how it works. I'm still learning, so.
            </div>
            <div> </div>
            <div>
              <strong>jb:</strong> You mentioned earlier that your mind is still
              in America?
            </div>
            <div> </div>
            <div>
              <strong>tds:</strong> Yeah, at times, yeah, unfortunately, yeah.
              In America sometimes but like actually it's also here. But a lot
              of the things I was trying to figure out because of my family's
              history, of them migrating around the world because of economic
              reasons, for hundreds of years. My dad comes from China, from
              Shanghai, but he's, Chinese, but part Portuguese and Dutch because
              of trade, of course. When you think about it, it's like, Yeah,
              China was opened up. And through religion and trade. So you have
              the Dutch also going over there. I mean, what explains my father's
              grandmother having red hair? Red haired woman in China? But yeah,
              it was actually a very cosmopolitan place.
            </div>
            <div> </div>
            <div>
              My mom's side is mostly descended from African slaves, with Native
              American blood. And my mom's father was half English and stuff. So
              for me it was always difficult: how do I make sense of this for
              myself? Because what culture do you identify with, somehow? We're
              American but we're also all these other types of people. And I was
              trying to figure that out in art. But I didn't want to ever draw a
              line and say, "I'm gonna make art about my Black experience" or
              whatever, because there actually was none. It's a mixture of
              everything.
            </div>
            <div> </div>
            <div>
              And the reason why I didn't wanna draw a line in anything and [I]
              focus more on objects—and objecthood—is because as soon as you say
              that you are this, then you, it's defining yourself based on what
              someone else is not. And sometimes that's very exclusive, it
              excludes other people. So for me I'd rather not really say it but
              just examine this through objects.
            </div>
            <div> </div>
            <div>
              That's how we all exist. I mean, we're surrounded by things that
              humans make or that occurs naturally. But we have relations with
              objects, also. And for a while, I used to think that it's really
              interesting to look at forms because there's all these histories
              within it. And with humans also our behavior in a way is a form.
              It kind of shows where you're coming from somehow, how you are. Or
              your mental state.

            <div> </div>
            <div>
              <strong>tds:</strong> My father, along with his parents, he
              emigrated. And this is interesting as well, because a lot of us
              kids, the third generation, we're all doing creative things. And
              it's something that John Adams, who was a former President, he
              wrote to his wife Abigail Adams, "I must study warfare in order
              for my sons to study, like naval architecture and engineering, in
              order for their sons to study tapestry and painting." And, um,
              sewing and all that stuff.
            </div>
            <div> </div>
            <div>
              It takes three generations finally to crawl out of poverty or to
              assimilate into another land, and to allow for your grandchildren
              to make art. To get to the point. Because someone has to crawl out
              of poverty, someone has to make money and get an education and
              then finally you're free, the next generation can make stuff. To
              think, to be able to have that time to think, and then make stuff.
            </div>

            <div> </div>
            <div>
              <strong>tds:</strong> And actually on my mom's side, her father,
              he considered himself "Coloured" but he was born in England to his
              English mother, who had red hair, and to a, his Black father. Who
              came from West Virginia, which was Fayetteville, a coal mining
              town. That man, my great grandpa, Alfonso Pierce, did not want to
              work in the coal mines, as a Black man. Or as any man! You don't
              want to work in the coal mines, it's terrible work, and terrible
              health effects.
            </div>
            <div> </div>
            <div>
              So he went up to Ohio and this is around the turn of the century,
              the 1900s, to get an education and he decided to jump on a ship
              and he fled to England where he met my great-grandma. They got
              married, they had a kid (my grandpa) then they emigrated 1926 to
              New York, to Manhattan and they lived there and stuff, actually.
              But it was very difficult because there was the crash of '29 but
              with Alfonso, I actually googled his name and I found him.
            </div>
            <div> </div>
            <div>
              He actually had a patent on making a toy in the '50s and it was
              really cool! It was like this little rubber band feather
              contraption that if you pull something it'll fly. But it was so
              cool to see something from my great-grandfather, still alive, in a
              US patent, I don't know, system. He was applying for a patent for
              this toy. Yeah yeah yeah.
