            <p>
              Join us as Svea runs into the car in her pyjamas and Jozefien is
              forced to scrunch under a low wooden table. All in the name of art
              (and Wilson, also in the name of Wilson). Our art crush David
              Wilson shows us his pristine “garage”, bougainvillea, and tape
              recorder. He talks FaceBook artist residency, drawing, bringing
              people together to sing and eat, and what happened when he had to
              cut just a few extra pieces for the garage ceiling. It rains.
              That’s very romantic. We demand snail mail and access to his
              outdoor shower.

                were small, and it was built in, I think, 1916, same year as our
                house. And when we first moved in, again, this was leaky, the
                floor would flood, it just was a very rough space. We are now
                kind of after a year of me chipping away at renovating the space
                we're in now, a clean and art-safe kind of space. So the floor
                is concrete and was recently re-poured and kind of has that
                freshness to it. The ceiling was a little exercise, where I used
                the wood that I use to make frames and basically used strips,
                this was about a 10 hour project of standing in front of a table
                saw, which did of course end up in an emergency room

                drawings. I always thought of it as kind of encouraging good
                habits in terms of mental health too, in terms of engaging
                walking, and engaging that time, and then I'd also had a

                friends you would do it in someone's house. So that home-based
                house show self-organising instinct was always a pretty natural
                thing; and just being a social person, that kind of translated
                into another side of my work that's evolved as kind of a
                community based organising practice. So I organise a lot of
                things and they tend to intersect out in the spaces I find when
