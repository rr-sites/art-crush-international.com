              We visit Simon Tran in his small, art-covered bedroom, which also
              functions as his studio. Tran is a Vietnamese-American artist who
              grew up in Los Angeles and graduated from UC Berkeley‚Äôs Fine Arts
              program as a painter. He gives us a tour of the old North Berkeley
              house he shares (built on top of a tunnel with a creek running
              through it), serves us strong coffee, and we huddle around the
              mics together, talking about how terrible his friends are (they‚Äôre
              all comedians), how much he admires architecture students, and how
              he is, in Svea‚Äôs words, ‚Äòjust a failed modernist‚Äô. We‚Äôre crazy
              about him.

                making these absurd things and creating these figures that are
