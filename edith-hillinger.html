                >We rush to visit Edith Hillinger at her garden studio inside
                the West Berkeley house she built in the 1990s. Hillinger is 88
                years old and studied at New York’s Cooper Union College in the
                1960s. She draws from her childhood experiences as a refugee in
                Ankara, Turkey, to create obscenely masterful full-scale
                collages and paintings. She quotes Rilke! She tells us about
                fleeing Nazi Germany, her marriage, the women’s movement (and
                how it helped her get a divorce), and what it’s like to be an
                accomplished female artist in her later years. We
                <em>fête</em> her.</span

                Nagirabat, that's a small bordertown with Romania. It keeps
                going back and forth, it's called Oredeia when it’s in Romania
                and Nagirabat when it’s in Hungary. And, he wanted to study to
                become an architect, but when he was ready to go to the
                university there was some sort of uprising and it was blamed on
                a Jew, Bella Kun, it was called the White Terror and I think
                about 5,000 people died and so, the University made a quota
                system for Jews, so he could not really enter the university in
                Hungary and he emigrated to Germany to study architecture. He
                was lucky, in that way he ended up working with Bruno
                Tout.</span

                role in, later on, in saving us from the death camps of the
                Nazis. So, my father came to Berlin and he was a very poor
                student, poor money-wise not otherwise. He needed to rent a room
                and he found a room with my mother's parents and that's really
                how they met, in Berlin.</span

                how my father met my mother and he became a German citizen.
                Everything seemed to be going well, my brother was born in 1930,
                I was born in 1933 and then off course the Nazi thing happened.

                then the president of Turkey, was inviting people who were
                fleeing Germany and Austria to come and help him build modern
                universities. So, when Bruno Tout got there, he heard that my
                family had not been able to find a way out of Nazi Germany and
                he asked the Turkish government to invite my father as an
                architect. I still have his letters and telegram that says:
                “Come immediately, family can follow in 3 months”. So, he went,
                and our family found a way out of Nazi Germany, we were very
