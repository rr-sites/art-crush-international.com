                      choreographer, and filmmaker Elle Sofe Sara. The wind
                      blows, the snow falls, the noses run, the hearts beat
                      wild. She talks the importance of refuelling, travel, an
                      old Sámi tradition called ‘ribadit’ where you grab your
                      crush’s belt and walk around with them, and what it was
                      like to move from the tundra to London at the age of 19.

                    working as an artist you are very much developing stuff all
                    the time and, like, giving very much. That half of the work
                    is also kind of the refueling. Yeah, so it's not just
                    producing new things, new art, new films, new performances.
                    But refueling part, maybe it's 50% and it's as important as
                    the production. Because the refueling also gives to the
                    artwork. So I have been more focused on that the last year.

                    about. But I also started out with my own choreographies to
                    Sámi music or to joik, and that was with me from the start.
                    And I remember that I used to perform in small events or
                    something and then get calls from the college or university
                    and could I come and perform, and when I was just very young
                    and made a choreography or joik to some Sámi music and

                    moved to London when I was 19, they said, "OK, you can do

                    artists in the beginning of 1900s but not so many. Like, in
                    my family on my mother's side, here in this area, they were
                    reindeer herders and they moved with the reindeer from this
                    area to the coast. Like we also do today. But at that time
                    they worked both the mother and the father worked full time
                    with that. And the kids went to school but in the beginning
                    the reindeer herding kids had school in the summer months,
                    or, connected to the cycles of how they move with the
                    reindeer. So it's just been very other culture and focus.
                    And it's maybe, how can you say, maybe like after WWII,
                    after 1950s that the Sámi community in this area had more
                    modernization or institutions, that people started to work
                    also outside the family.</span

                    is joik and duodji, I'm sure there are other ways to be an

                    originally 10 Sámi languages and I speak Northern Sámi,
                    which is the biggest language, there are about 20,000 people
                    who speak it, so it's not a lot. And the Sámi languages, are
                    one of those that have undergone this Norwegianization
                    process, or Swedenization, it was forbidden to speak in
                    schools like when my parents grew up. So it's not that long
                    time ago, my parents remember that they couldn't speak Sámi
                    and they learned Norwegian in school, in the boarder
                    schools. And so Sámi language has been through rough times
                    and now Sámi is an official language in Norway but of course
                    there is a lack of books and material to learn it. And also,
                    children's series and children's books and everything. So,
                    me and my husband, we both speak Sámi fluently but we also
                    see that Norwegian is a big, that our kids also get very

                    techniques, so I was new to dancing and also this kind of
                    living in the city and yeah, everything that comes with
                    that. So, it was, I was really exhausted the first time.
                    Like, the first months. There's so much sound, also, in
                    London. It's never quiet. So I was really exhausted but at
                    the same time I really loved the school, I loved to learn

                    choregraphing the audience, the audience is participating in
                    the work, with seven performers, joikers and dancers. And
                    what I'm trying to kind of do there is to give this
                    experience to be part of something. Part of a community or
                    part of a traditional song. To be there, experiencing it
                    with the body. And I don't know if I have seen that kind of
                    work other places, but it's kind of this, how—how, I'm,
                    interested in how we can take Sámi perspectives or views,
                    also on dramaturgy and time, how I can shape that in an
                    artwork. In a performance for example. That I don't just use
                    linear story, but that I can in some way make the audience
                    experience things in a different way. To experience the
                    ground that we are on, that we share. Or experience time in
                    a different way. That's kind of my nerdy stuff that I feel
                    that there is a lot of potential, not just to do theatre in
                    Sámi language and that's Sámi theatre, but that you actually
                    look, at what can a theatre be, what can a performance be,

                    dance and working wherever people asked me to come. But when
                    I became a mom I became more rooted also in this village. So
                    I had to kind of shift a little bit. And at first I just
                    kind of took every job that I got. Also in theatre,
                    choreography, films, stuff like that, and also
                    administration work for the Sámi artist collective. But two
                    years ago I took a decision that this is too exhausting to
                    do so much different things. That I took a choice and I
                    said, "OK now I'm going to focus on these two projects and

                    But tradition was that the guys could pull a girl in the

                    stories where the guy's mother also comes to hold the girl

                    I have to kind of also, sometimes kind of protect myself in
                    a way that I don't feel bad about it every day. Even though
                    it affects, especially the reindeer herding future. Which is
                    also the future of my kids. But I have to maybe think a
                    little bit, what I can do to reverse it and to change
                    climate change. But I also have to be present and look at
                    the beauty which is now. Many things in Sámi society are
                    very difficult. There are many, many social issues or many
                    political issues, that are there all the time. And they are
                    pressing, in our culture and language. Which can be very
                    hard if you really get into it and experience it every day.
                    I have to be aware of it but also to appreciate the nice
                    things that we have.</span
