              Join us on a trip to Oostakker, Belgium where we meet textile
              designer Leda Devoldere in the art studio she has in her parents'
              garden. Leda designs carpets, pillows and plaids in bright,
              vibrant colors and abstract shapes. She also has a lisp, which
              makes some English words hard to pronounce and her voice very easy
              to love. She knits almost all of her work by hand on her historic
              hand knitting machine, which makes every single object a real act
              of devotion. We are in full awe of all this beauty and high design
              coziness!

                  >Leda and I met at the Academy of Fine Arts in Belgium, where
                  we were both studying textile design. One of my favourite
                  stories about Leda is about her pet turtle, for which she only
                  got to care for a short period of time before it passed away.
                  It was winter when the turtle had died and she and her mom had
                  buried it in the garden.</i

                  winter and that she might have buried her sleeping pet alive.
                  The emotions I saw on Leda's face that moment are
                  indescribable. And when I think about it, I actually still
                  don't know the end to that story...</i

                different spaces and I was doing this kind of research: what's

                the playing is always a way to free the mind, a way of getting
                away from reality. When you play you are in focus. I don't play
                that often anymore. But the way that I play is when I make my
                installations or make stuff: I always arrange and it's like
                something gives a way of a structure. And for me it feels like

                you don't think about anything anymore. Just the rules that you

                don't use the machine anymore and I would like you to have it.'
                And I just like the whole story and the history, of the fact
                that she made these sweaters for me 20 years ago and now I have

                just in our lives. And the work that I do with Berlinde De
                Bruyckere, she makes rules and it's also, it also feels like a
                freedom that I don't have to make my own rules. And there I can
                just play with my hands and work with wax, with textiles, and
                really like <i>make</i> stuff. But not by making my own rules.
                And in my work, I make my own rules and I don't really make
                stuff right now! It's an interesting thing, I don't know if I'm
                saying it right or if you understand me but—<br

                turtles, when you put them in like a very very small aquarium
                they are always going to stay tiny. And when you put them in a
                lake, they grow and they become super big. And I think it's the
                same with my studio space. It's very small and right now all the
                things I make are very small. And I think when my studio space
                would be bigger, my work will grow automatically. Yeah.<br
