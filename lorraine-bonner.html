              Onward! To East Oakland where artist-physician-writer Lorraine
              Bonner sculpts clay in the house that was once her mother’s home.
              Lorraine shows us the space, now converted completely to a
              studio-gallery, and talks about growing up in Queens, moving to
              rural California in 1970, moving to Tanzania with her husband so
              they could have their baby in an African socialist country, and
              studying Medicine at Stanford with two small children at home.
              Bonner’s work addresses personal, societal, and environmental
              traumas including racism, abuse, and torture through figurines and
              abstract shapes. How does she navigate such heavy topics without
              buckling under their weight? Why doesn’t she want to be a doctor
              anymore? What does it mean to “redeem” the colour black?

            <p class="p1">All this and more. Plus cat.</p>

                of Queens. I moved out of Queens to go to school in Boston and
                Cambridge. And then I came here in '70. I had graduated and I
                was kind of, just kind of drifting a little bit. And I met this
                guy who had just come from California, driving cross country
                with his friend and they were about to go back. And I said, "You
                know, I’ve been thinking a lot about going to California, what
                if I come with you?" So we all drove cross country and came back
                here. We lived on Sonoma mountain for a while. From Sonoma we
                went to Africa, Tanzania. I was pregnant, we had our baby in

                do something. “But you know, it felt like we really had a
                responsibility for here. You know. This is where we really need
                to do the work, we can't go over to somebody else's country and

                there for three years and I was trying to put together a
                multi-disciplinary pain practice and there were maybe 4 or 5
                other women that had different modalities, physical therapist,
                somebody that was doing Trager, somebody that was doing

                ask you—if you're bieng hurt, if anybody's hurting you at home.
                But they don't ask the perpetrators: are you beating up your

                combination of the black and the white. So the perpetrators are

                ><strong>LB</strong>: I like every part of this space. I love it
                that it gets so much sun, I love the fact that I have a little
                kitchen and if I do wanna eat something I have a little frozen
                Trader Joe burrito in the freezer, you know [laughter]. I love
                the gallery space, I love the light. I love my cozy room. It's
                just so nice. The only thing I would like is more workspace.
                Which, you know, that's just a trap.</span

                >Because when you have more workspace then you need more
                workspace. It's like the first kiln I got was like 8 inches by 8
                inches, and I was happy with that and then pretty soon I was
                making work that was too big to fit in that little kiln. Then I
                had to get a bigger kiln then I got a bigger kiln and then that
                got to be too small! And then, you know, I mean, it just, so,
                although I say I'd like more space I know that it would not
                really work.</span

                >The big challenge for me now is getting the work out. Because I
                think it is important. I think that there's something about it
                that is really in tune with the times. The whole personal is
                political, the political is spiritual, the planet is involved in
                everything. So getting the work out, where it can be seen, is, I
                think, a really important thing for me to do and it's very
                challenging. And especially because as I see the whole emphasis
                is on young artists, and I can't claim that anymore.

                Particularly in terms of faces. I wanna make more heads. I never
                went to art school so there's a whole bunch of stuff that I
                never learned, like portraiture. I've done a few portraits but
                they are agonising, it just takes me forever and I never can
                seem to get it right.</span

                heads, there's one at the house, I usually make the heads—the
                heads are very particular about how their hair is gonna be. Or
                if they're gonna have a head wrap or something. Those pieces,
                that part of the piece, would get glazed, either the hair would
                get glazed a colour. I’ve got one that has a head wrap with a
                little flower on it. Very cute. [laughter] Stuff I would never
                do for myself. But the pieces want that so, “Ok, you can have
                that!”</span
