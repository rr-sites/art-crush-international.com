              Hop into our car to East Oakland where we’ll meet textile artist
              Richard Jonathan Nelson at his friend and fellow artist Jamee
              Crusan’s place. Richard talks about being a black, queer man in
              the US, how his mother and aunts encouraged him to make textile
              art as a child and how language plays an important role in his
              life. What’s a hand baby and who brought the Kudzu? Richard tells
              us all.

              <span class="s1"
                ><strong>RN</strong>: I was originally introduced to making from
                my grandmother and my mother. I come from a long line of
                seamstresses in the deep South. And so when they were sewing for
                other people to make clothes and different items they would give
                me fabric to make toys. I would make weird technicolour animals.
                It was a mixture of this soft sculpture queerness that was
                inherent in me, and then the masculinity of being a boy. So, I
                would take like transformers but then make them these fantasy
                playhouses for technicolour animals. And so inside this rigid
                structure of what it meant to be a boy, I would have these
                fantasy worlds that were very much about magic and light and
                just happiness.</span
              >
            </p>
            <p class="p3">
              <span class="s1"
                ><strong>SV</strong>: Did anybody else make any textile toys for
                you?</span
              >
            </p>
            <p class="p3">
              <span class="s1"
                ><strong>RN</strong>: They would show me how to make practical
                things or things that I would want. So if I wanted a new shirt
                they would show me how to make a new shirt. Or if I just wanted
                to make something weird like, cushions or just like, a weird,
                fifty foot scarf, they would be like, I'll show you how to do it
                and just…Go! Just do whatever you want. We're not gonna
                constrain you or say what you need to make or if it has to be
                functional. If you wanna mix colours and play around just play
                with materials, yeah. And so I would go with them to fabric
                stores often, every weekend, and just browse the colours and mix
                and match and play. That wonder of an overwhelming textile
                sensation, just being a child and running your hand over all the
                fabrics, associating colour with a physical object.</span

                ><strong>JB</strong>: And so, you were doing that as a kid. And
                you, then you decided to go to art school, after that? And to
                keep on doing the same thing?</span

            <p class="p3">
              <span class="s1"
                ><strong>RN</strong>: I started with that. And then when I got
                to high school there were a few textile courses. And so I took
                the textile courses where I was introduced to weaving and basket
                making. And painting on silk. And I was like, “Oh, this is
                interesting.” But I didn't really think anything of it at the
                moment. So I put it away and I pursued a more classical idea of
                what it meant to have an art career. So I was going to school
                for graphic design and very traditional things.</span

                ><strong>RN</strong>: It wasn't the normal-normal high school.
                It—funny thing was, it was the high school my mother went to for
                integration, that she was bussed into. So decades before she
                went to the same high school, which was in the “better” part of
                town, the whiter part of town. And she went there and then later
                in life when she married my father they moved to that part of
                town and I ended up going to school there. So it was an
                interesting neighbourhood to be in a, what is historically a
                very white, affluent part of the city, and there were horse
                ranches near it, and there were a golf course near it, we had a
                golf team. It... It was interesting to be in a place that was
                this sort of unwelcoming and had to be opened up by my mother.
                And to then be in the legacy of that.</span

                happening there. And so it, we were afforded these opportunities
                because we were in this more affluent part of town but still
                being the minority and the outlier and the new thing? Because
                there were, I want to say, four black families in my entire
                neighbourhood. But there was a good Black population in the
                school. But they lived on the opposite side of the, like,
                dividing line near there. But yeah.</span

                that was very much how I was able to get to college. Because I
                was a first generation college student. I'm the first one to get
                a MA or any sort of higher education in my family. And just, the
                people that supported me. Who I still speak to. Who, like, my

                textiles. I've always wanted to know how they're actually made."
                Because I’d only been, at that point, I was only engaging with
                textiles as a finished product from someone else. And so to see

                together. It does connect back to my childhood of taking, like,
                "How do you take an idea of who you are and fit it into a larger
                structure that's been before you? And how do you change that

                mother's side of the family on the South Carolina side and my
                father's family on the Georgia side. I had never been fully
                introduced to my Southern Carolina side. So we went back, and

                Like the house is gone. The plantation house is completely gone.
                The land was sold. It is now a protected bird reserve. But the
                owner, because his wife loved ibises brought them there. So
                there's supposed to be a lake in the middle of it that has birds

                making at the beginning of the year, about plants and the Black
                body, and these constructed narratives. Realising that what I
                think of the South and what I think of that space, isn't
                actually? That there is this sort of layers of like, colonialism
                and the natural landscape and then like, a Japanese revival, so
                there is this sort of…masses of kudzu and bamboo, and like,
                mulberry trees. And wisteria. And that was a weird sort of
                realisation. That what I think, because I've grown up there my
                entire life, of this place as being, is really just multiple
                layers of influence and manipulation by outside cultures. And so
                that is something that I'm just like, “Wait, where is this?
                Like, I want to see this.” And I want to see how the land has
                changed. But then the land is also ingrained in me. Because my

                ><strong>RN</strong>: For me, someplace where I could set up
                multiple looms. I've also been doing this series of performing
                humanity photos. They are these multi-layered sets I'm creating
                with flowers and textiles and physical objects and me in makeup
                and digital prints. And it would be nice to have a space that I
                could set all this up and take these sort of durational photos
                and durational video that I don't have to take down because the
                makeup is so intensive.</span

                artificial alien transformative makeup but then what would that
                mean to get on BART after doing it? And sort of take a very long
                BART ride, dressed like a multidimensional demon just sort of
                staring at somebody like, [sweet voice] "Just going to the
                studio" so I would like someplace close [laughter].</span

                “Well I've been on BART for a couple of stops and I'm just, oh
                God, I'm smearing blue all over everything!” [laughter] But I
                would like a space that has that sort of comfort to it. That I
                can be vulnerable and sort of change and turn into different
                things and do these very slow processes.</span

                ><strong>JB</strong>: I have maybe another question. You
                mentioned that you moved to the Bay Area because you wanted to
                be able to talk to people about being queer. And I’m wondering
                if you've found that here.</span

                ><strong>RN</strong>: I found a very intellectual, complex
                conversation around queerness and identity. And I'm very happy
                to find an older population of queer individuals. And to be able
                to see happiness and joy and that you can have long-lasting
                relationships and be who you are, to fully express who you are.
                Even though that does feel like it's disappearing from the Bay.
                There still are these holdouts and these people who are very
                much themselves and every expression of themselves and it's just
                like, "Oh my goodness, you've had this beautiful life.” And it
                has given me hope. And that has driven my work, to think about:
                what will I be like when I'm 80? Or like, how will I be in the
                world?</span
