              Join us on conceptual/installation/social practice artist Michele
              Pred's red couch in her white-walled studio at Faultline Artspace
              in East Oakland, California. Pred is a Swedish-American artist who
              started the "Art of Equal Pay" movement to encourage female and
              non-binary artists to charge more. She's got a billboard in New
              York City all about it. With us, she talks about the "Power of the
              Purse" series, a collection of vintage purses that blink light-up
              political messages. Does your purse do that? Not yet. Her couch is
              from IKEA and her work is from the heart.

                I was going to Martin Luther King Junior High, in Berkeley, and
                noticed that the boys didn't have to wear a uniform for PE and

                neither. So he and I decided to try to change that.</span

                body, my business,' that's a text I came up with several years
                ago. And other people had used it in other formats, in the body
                building world and, but now it's being used a lot more as sort
                of a feminist tag line. But they actually represent me, myself.
                And women. They're obviously something probably most women carry

                wire and cut what was sort of like a window, and put a piece of
                glass. So you could look into the purse and see the barbed wire.
                And that represented what was inside of me: a lot of pain. And
                so I've done collages with purses for years. They, to me,

                your purse, you don't necessarily always wanna share that with
                other people, it's very personal. And so to me they represent,

                ><strong>MP</strong>: I also just think they're beautiful in
                themselves. I collect these vintage purses and each one is so
                unique and they have a story, they've all been carried by
                someone. They've maybe been sitting in a closet a lot but they
                were part of someone's life and then now they're having a second
                life. And that's really interesting to me as well.</span

                >I actually, when I started making purses again (I hadn't for a
                long time), this was back in 2011, I started making birth
                control purses so they actually, and that was also about what's
                on the inside, what they would carry, and that's also about
                reproductive rights and access to birth control. So I started
                collaging hundreds and thousands of birth control pills on
                purses. And again that was about making a statement on the
                outside, something that we normally carry inside of our
                purse.</span

              <span class="s1"
                >And then I started making some neon pieces. With actual neon.
                And on vintage train cases, the round cases, often American
                Tourister bags. I loved the symbolism of them as well. And that
                refers to traveling too, like being on an airplane, and I grew
                up traveling a lot, my mom the stewardess...So it hearkens back,
                yeah to a  lot of different ideas. So I made several of these
                and I'm still making them.</span

                >And then what happened in 2013, I was gonna go to the Armoury
                fair in New York. And I had been making some of these, actual
                neon purses. And I'd learned about luminescent wire. And all you
                need is a battery. It doesn't have to be plugged into a wall.
                The big neon pieces are stationary. You can't walk around with
                them. And I thought, 'I wanna make one that I can wear. And it's
                gonna be about reproductive rights. It's gonna be about
                pro-choice.' And literally the day before I was flying out, I
                made a purse that said 'choice' on it.</span
