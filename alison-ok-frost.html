                >This episode is dedicated to Bay Area artist Gary Hackett, who
                died suddenly. He was a good friend of Alison OK Frost, and this
                episode was postponed out of respect for her. We are grateful
                for Hackett’s presence in the Bay Area: an artist precariously
                housed and studiously generous with his time and care. It’s a
                little less colourful now, with him gone.</span

                >We go with realist painter and arts educator Alison OK Frost to
                the Mosswood Park homeless encampment in Oakland, California.
                Frost is interested in humanity and creativity; she paints from
                photographs taken of homeless encampment citizen architecture
                (tents, tarps, wheelchairs, trees, mannequins, and other
                artefacts of ingenuity). It’s a hot day and Jozefien is feeling
                really woozy.* We help Frost deliver socks and bottles of water
                to camp residents, make friends with an artist named Rose, and
                find out why Frost wants her daughter and her students to learn
                more about the “two Bay Areas.”</span

                people who take a lot of pride in their tents and have a strong
                sense of community. But then every summer Burger Boogaloo does
                the big concert in the park and everyone gets kicked out. Which
                is a bummer because I feel like, well I don't know, I guess
                that’s just the problem that's happening right now in Oakland,
                where you know, how is public space used, you know? And can it
                be used for housing?</span

                And I had to explain to her that's actually not what's
                happening. And I've been taking her with me sometimes into the
                camps so she's getting to know some of the residents in a couple
                of the camps. For a while down on Shellmound this woman Cheyenne
                was measuring her height on the telephone pole when we would
                come by, but now, now that camp has been evicted…</span

                I always did art and my parents are really supportive of that.
                So I was a pretty weird artsy kid and I would go through, we
                always had museum subscriptions and things like that. So I would
                go through the museum pamphlets and just ask my mom to take me,
                "Oh there's a Toulouse Lautrec movie at the LA County Art Museum
                this weekend, can we go to that?" when I was eight or nine and
                my mom was so sweet. She never said, "No, that's a super weird
                thing for a nine year old to ask," you know? She was really
                accommodating. So I've always been interested in art, I've
                always been encouraged.</span

                which at the time was a very conceptual program. It was very
                unpopular to be a realist painter there. But I feel like that
                was kind of good for me because I really learned to defend, I
                learned to talk about why I was doing realist paintings from
                photographs, what that meant, and sort of define my process at a
                much younger age than a lot of artists. And then I got my
                graduate degree in New York at SVA, the School of Visual Arts,
                an art school in the Chelsea neighbourhood.</span

                competitive the way artists in LA and especially New York can
                be. Like I feel like I was really welcomed. And I was right away
                invited to come draw with people and spend time with them. A lot
                of my work when I lived in NY was looking at how women were
                historically portrayed and just working in this really
                historical context and once I got here it's like I sort of
                switched gears and I wanted to make art more about what was
                going on around me. And kind of what I was seeing in the world
                and locally.</span

                Paintings. I've been working on this for about a year. Although
                there was probably a year or two before that when I was trying
                to figure out what would be the best way to make, to make art
                about the problem of the unhoused. There is sort of a landscape
                in the Bay Area, I feel like, it's almost like there are two Bay
                Areas. There's sort of the, you know, Uber, Google, FaceBook,
                money landscape where everyone has apps to do these scavenger
                hunts and other ways of spending their money and fill their
                time.</span

                the landscape where people are really struggling and the success
                and prosperity brought on by tech and finance and financing
                tech, is pushing people further to the margins. And it seems
                almost like a whole segment of the population is becoming
                invisible. You know, just sort of thinking about landscape
                painting in terms of these two, these two landscapes being laid
                on top of each other. Was something I wanted to work with for a
                long time before I actually started making the work.</span

                like that, I was driving by—actually, Mosswood—and there was
                this grey building, one of the Kaiser Buildings and there was an
                orange tent against it and the way that the grey kind of
                activated the orange was really exciting to me and I thought

                so that I could ask permission. And talk to people and not feel
                for myself like I was being exploitive. Taking the aesthetic

                and have a bunch of material for paintings. But what ends up
                happening is I start talking to people and I get a lot more
                interested in that process! And then it ends up that I have to
                go back, take more pictures, and I kind of like that though,

                like and I think moving forward I would really like to do some
                portraits. We've ben talking a lot about portraying the ‘other’.
                What I really don't wanna do is do paintings of people looking
                sad, or looking something where I can create a catharsis
                experience for people in the art world who might feel like
                they're not doing enough. Because I don't think it's about
                catharsis for people who have everything that they need or close
                to everything they need. I think it's more about presenting,

                they're using atmospheric perspective. So everything that's
                further away from you, it's in fog. And you see a lot of that

                nice actually to have a studio practice that involves a lot of
                being outside and talking to people and just being sort of
                engaged with other people. I've gotten more interested, too, in
                sort of the in-between, I've been going more to train cars, i
                mean, to the train yards, and doing drawings like on tankers and
                things like that. Just because I like, you know I like the

                interesting, which part is the art? Is the art the finished
                paintings? Or is the art the practice of going out and talking
                to people and recording their experience? Or at least talking to
                them about their experience? Because if that's the art and the
                paintings are just a remnant then it's definitely a social
                practice. And it's also interesting that a lot of the people who
                are interested in these paintings are more interested in what's
                being depicted than how, how it's depicted. And I've, had a lot
                of interest from people who are working more on the activist
                side. They're not a great money maker [laughter] I'm definitely
