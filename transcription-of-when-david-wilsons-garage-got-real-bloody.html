Because you got mail from David Wilson </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> Oh, I did get mail from DW but I never sent him a letter, he just sends me things.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>jb: </strong>OMG you lucky woman</span><span class="s2">. </span><span class="s1">[laughter]</span> <span class="s1">So this is very postal mail pleasing, I would say</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> Yes, definitely, that's definitely what I would call it </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>jb:</strong> It's like a party in your mailbox!</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> Shall we, let's take them. Let's go</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>jb:</strong> Yup, it's exciting</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> I'm glad you're excited. Let's gooo</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>dw:</strong> My name is David Wilson and I'm an artist and I live in Oakland, California, and I like to draw and I like to organise things</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> So Jozefien picked me up, and I was not available because I was on a call, because I had completely forgotten this interview, and so I'm actually wearing my pyjamas</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>jb:</strong> Oooh, nice!</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> That's my pyjamas [giggling] but at least I'm wearing a bra.

Huh.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> Is there a path to the back? </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>jb:</strong> Well, on the other side I thought...</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv: </strong>Maybe we should try that before we disturb a family</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>jb:</strong> Before we ring the doorbell</span><span class="s1"> </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>vo:</strong> We push open the unlocked wooden gate and step inside</span><span class="s1"> </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> OK, let's hope we don't get shot, this is America. OH MY GOD LOOK AT THIS BOUGAINVILLEA, IT'S SO GORGEOUS</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>jb:</strong> Svea gets really excited about a huge bougainvillea plant that's growing up the side of the house and hanging down over a large handcrafted wooden table</span><span class="s1"> </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> *shimmer noise* I love bougainvillea and if you do too you should follow this strange little IG account called for_the_love_of_boug. *shimmer noise*</span><span class="s1"> </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> This whole thing with the table... Hi! How are you? Sorry we're late</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>dw:</strong> Oh, no worries </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv: </strong>Beautiful place</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>dw:</strong> Welcome</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>jb:</strong> Hi! </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>dw:</strong> Nice to see you again </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>vo:</strong> We meet David, who is standing in his immaculate art space. It's not quite a studio because he does most of his artwork outside so this is a place for carefully storing artwork. For thinking about things, for designing things. Organising things.</span><span class="s1"> </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>jb:</strong> It's very nice. It's a beautiful art studio</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>dw:</strong> And since I work outside primarily, I wanted to be able to have the kind of space that would be more for looking at art since making work tends to happen outside so not needing it to be, basically the function is to look at things.</span><span class="s1"> </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>jb:</strong> There's a lot of beautifully framed drawings of natural items, landscapes, the great outdoors. </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>dw:</strong> It was formerly a garage, back when cars were small, and it was built in, I think, 1916, same year as our house. And when we first moved in, again, this was leaky, the floor would flood, it just was a very rough space. We are now kind of after a year of me chipping away at renovating the space we're in now, a clean and art-safe kind of space. So the floor is concrete and was recently re-poured and kind of has that freshness to it. The ceiling was a little exercise, where I used the wood that I use to make frames and basically used strips, this was about a 10 hour project of standing in front of a table saw, which did of course end up in an emergency room visit.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> Did it? Really?</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>dw:</strong> It did, yeah it did, yeah,</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>jb:</strong> And of course, Svea wants to hear more about that.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> What happened?</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>dw:</strong> Well, of course, when I got to the point where I had safely felt like I had milled enough of this material to do this ceiling, I thought <i>I don't wanna have to realise I've come up short</i>,<i> so let me do just even more</i>. And that was, my eyes were glazed over, and I just reached in, just touched the saw blade as it was spinning. </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> Do you have a scar?</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>dw:</strong> Well it's amazing, the body, it's a very subtle scar on the tip of my thumb... I reached in</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv: </strong>Where, it's horizontal?</span><span class="s1"> </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>dw:</strong> Yeah it's kind of just across the tip there—</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> Wow, hardly at all.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>dw:</strong> I just reached in there and just zip, right across there, and so of course there is one piece in here that's got a little bloodstain on it.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> Where is it?</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>dw:</strong> Ummm</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>jb:</strong> And of course, Svea wants to find that bloodied piece on the ceiling</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>dw:</strong> The actual piece is on the side of the house, but there's a little drop... </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> This is the literal sweat and blood of the artist</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>dw:</strong> Well you can see some of the saw marks there, I think it was in one these ones...</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> How many stitches?</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>dw:</strong> It was actually the glue. They went for the glue. But anyway I'm whole and the room, you know, has that little extra ju-ju. But yeah it's a wood ceiling, strips of old growth douglas fir.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">And yeah, you're pointing at my cassette player, which is probably my twelfth one of those, if not more, I have a real relationship with that particular model, it's a, you know, battery powered, it has a built in microphone, a really nice condenser microphone, so it tends to make everything sound good if you're recording outside. Which I tend to do, with a lot of the kind of gathering projects that I do. So yeah there's a chunk of wood serving as a stand, also a storage solution.</span><span class="s1"> </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> Cool</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>dw:</strong> Yeah, got some tapes in the works</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> Do you listen to music when you're working?</span><span class="s1"> </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>dw:</strong> Yeah I do, I really like listening to music</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> What are you listening to now? </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>dw:</strong> Let's see right now, I think it's uh...My dentist growing up as a child, he was a very awkward Vietnam vet who didn't have much of an ease of rapport with his younger kids, who he worked on. His son was a bootleg tape guy at a flea market and offered them as a way of connecting with the kids in his practice.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">But I was, in the end, really the only kid who was taking him up on it. So every time I went to his place he would just let me go wild in, like, the bootleg tape room of the dentist office. So this is the Talking Heads live, this is from the Stop Making Sense Tour so yeah, live in Milwaukee, ‘84. So this is how I got a lot of music actually. </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> What are these here?</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>dw:</strong> This was a gift from my friend Kelly Best, who is a woodworker in the Bay Area. He's an aesthete in his own very rough, natural way. I forget which tool store this is from, it might be from Hida tool down in North Berkeley but yeah, I've since worked with him and a few others.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Paul Discoe, who is kind of like an OG woodworker in West Oakland, who was part of the first wave of the San Francisco Zen Centre coming to the Bay Area, and was sent by Suzuki Roshi, the teacher, to go to Japan to learn temple carpentry in the 70s. He lived there for a few years.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">He's just a real resource in this pre-industrial Japanese style carpentry and I've worked with him and a group of people on a couple of projects, but one more involved five year long house building project; so yeah, this is a chisel I am holding, you can see I have not taken the best care of it. There's chips and things in the front, which Paul would not be happy with, but the first phase of that class was basically learning to sharpen your chisel on a stone, a wet stone, which I missed actually, I was working on a project when I arrived. </span><span class="s1"> </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>jb:</strong> So you never learned it</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>dw:</strong> I never like learned the proper technique. I'm always like, am I doing it right? Well also, I'm a little, I'm a little neglectful and lazy, but that's ok.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>vo: </strong>David shows us his catalogue of invitations.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>dw:</strong> I made this box and started putting this together...</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>vo: </strong>Paper archived in a hand-made wooden box—and they are literally invitations, to music events, art events, community events. </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>dw:</strong> I like how it came out. So It's basically a photocopied, um, little guide to what's in this box with these miniatures. </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> What was the FaceBook thing you did?</span><span class="s1"> </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>vo:</strong> David was the first artist in residence at FaceBook and he invited the employees to hang out on the salt flats near their offices. </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>vo:</strong> He also made them return the invitation in a wooden box if they wanted a print of one of his salt flat drawings.</span><span class="s1"> </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>dw:</strong> And then having these incidental little conversations with their neighbours of like, "Oh, I meant to do that, do you have any extra?" And being like—</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>vo: </strong>And if they didn't do it..? He didn't give it to them</span><span class="s1"> </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>dw:</strong> 'Oh no sorry, that was kind of a point, wanting to have that kind of commitment to each other,' you know that kind of little, teaching them a lesson.</span><span class="s1"> </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> They're like ‘WHAT?!’</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>dw:</strong> Yeah!</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> ‘The artist, not at my service??’</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>dw:</strong> Yeah, so it was kind of cool, I had a good experience.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> Do you do any artwork outside here?</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>dw:</strong> At my house?</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> Yeah</span><span class="s1"> </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>dw:</strong> I'll draw outside but mostly it's by design an incentive to kind of walk, </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> To go onsite</span><span class="s1"> </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>dw:</strong> But I can show you something which is kind of cool.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>jb: </strong>It's the coolest thing ever</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> No way! You have an outdoor shower?</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>dw:</strong> And, uh, an outdoor toilet [flushes toilet]</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>vo:</strong> An outdoor shower. In Oakland.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> What's this handle from?</span><span class="s1"> </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>dw:</strong> The handle was sent to me by my friend who lives in Cape Cod who I spent a lot of time with growing up</span><span class="s1"> </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv: </strong>That's amazing</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"> </span><span class="s1"><strong>jb:</strong> I want one… Right now.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> But do you shower out here? </span><span class="s1"> </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>dw:</strong> Yeah, this is where I shower and often go to the bathroom</span><span class="s1"> </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> Oh, you're toilet paper is all soggy in the rain</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>dw:</strong> Yeah, I have to start...</span><span class="s1"> </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>vo: </strong>We head back inside and look for our best potential audio.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> Wait, does that come out?</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>dw:</strong> We can roll it out, yeah...</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> OK, how flexible are you?</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"> </span><span class="s1"><strong>dw:</strong> In terms of,</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> Like would you be </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>dw:</strong> Like, physically flexible?</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>vo:</strong> It's probably the big low table on which David was showing us the invitations he'd made over the years. </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>dw:</strong> Yeah yeah yeah, you know, I'm...</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> Would you be able to sit underneath that table?</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>dw:</strong> Sure</span><span class="s1"> </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> With us?</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>dw:</strong> We can get under there.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>vo: </strong>I crawl in first and David offers me a cushion</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> Oh, well, there's only one</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>dw:</strong> I can sit on this</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> But what's Jozefien gonna sit on? </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>dw:</strong> Oh... </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>vo:</strong> Then Jozefien begins to pass me the equipment</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> This one is for us..?</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>jb:</strong> Yeah, one of them, like, one of them</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> Do these tripods go any lower? Is this as low as they can go?</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>jb:</strong> Is it too high?</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> Yeah, this is, uh...</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>vo:</strong> And I grab at the mics blindly because I can move my arms but not my head</span><span class="s1"> </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> Yeah, I mean, it'll probably be OK</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>vo: </strong>David crawls in opposite us</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>dw:</strong> OK, I'll sit down, and do more of a recline I think</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> Yeah you can, but we need you to be close to this guy</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>dw:</strong> Is this close enough?</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> No</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>dw:</strong> No? How close?</span><span class="s1"> </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>jb: </strong>With the small wooden box Svea has manoeuvred into a mic table between us. I'm too tall to sit up entirely so I kind of lean up against Svea's legs. [laughter] Very cozy.</span><span class="s1"> </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">[Musical interlude]</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>dw:</strong> I grew up in Massachusets and I'm an East coast person, so basically hung out in that area for most of my life. I went to school at Wesleyan University in Connecticut so that's also right in the pocket there, so uh, studied art amongst other things there, religion and philosophy and cultural studies, and moved pretty directly into a focus on drawing, coming from a few years in the painting department.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">And that was also a shift for me back into what felt like the inspiration and agency of exploration. I kind of always thought about that moment as kind of an important one, just to kind of think about what way you work as the central question in art making, and finding the way to work that enables you to be the way that feels right and the way you wanna kind of engage the world. </span><span class="s1"> </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">So moving out of the studio was very liberating, as well as finding material, such as drawing, that was very portable that just kind of became my counterpoint to movement, moving through this town and getting to know it really deeply. So I spent my final year there kind of making a series of, you know, surveying drawings. I always thought of it as kind of encouraging good habits in terms of mental health too, in terms of engaging walking, and engaging that time, and then I'd also had a background in music. </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">So planning shows was a part of my early childhood and you know, high school time, growing up in suburban places where there weren't necessarily—if you want to play music for your friends you would do it in someone's house. So that home-based house show self-organising instinct was always a pretty natural thing; and just being a social person, that kind of translated into another side of my work that's evolved as kind of a community based organising practice. So I organise a lot of things and they tend to intersect out in the spaces I find when I'm drawing. </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Moving to California when I was 23, I was kind of taken by that intersection and proximity between the city and the open space, so my time drawing again was just a perfect kind of counterpoint to get to know this new area and to take it in through the lines and then share it through the organising so, bringing people together in these different spaces that I had gotten to know while drawing.</span><span class="s1"> </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>jb:</strong> Was there a specific reason why you moved to the Bay Area, or why you chose the Bay Area? </span><span class="s1"> </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>dw:</strong> Well, it was incidental in some ways but a friend had spent time growing up—she grew up in Chicago but had family out here, so she'd kind of been exposed to this place—and was excited to try and rally a crew of friends to move together. And you know, this was in 2005, so the idea of getting a warehouse space in West Oakland and having a spot to land and you know, get into things and all that was very tangible and real. </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">I'd never been really out of New England and wanted to see what was going on out here and thought at least I would come visit my friends who were living here and get a sense for what this place was. So I visited and some friends lived very close by here, in Berkeley, and we, you know, we cruised the Berkeley hills, went for that loop in Stinson, up the hill, up Mount Tam, that kind of open space experience, and went to see a show at Lo Bot at the time, which was a warehouse in West Oakland and kind of got a feel for...it felt like a very porous art community and that there was that spirit of self organising was very clear to me immediately.</span><span class="s1"> </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">I had never really experienced a place where you could move into both, like a powerful nature experience and then this powerful community experience within a day, I was like going back and forth. So that kind of blew my mind and it just felt natural. I just could imagine myself here.</span><span class="s1"> </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">The period where I was working at a bakery, I was doing these early morning bakery routes, I would start at 5am and initially I didn't know the area at all so it would take me you know, a couple hours to get through it all. Eventually as I got to know the area and just got to know my route faster and faster, I could go faster and faster and end up with an hour to basically have on my own. So during those little bakery delivery hours I explored found all these different spots that have since been touchstones for various projects and drawing ideas.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">And then I kind of proposed organising something there with those friends I was playing music with, and just put together a little evening event and people used a map that we made and came together to hang out and listen to some music.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">It was quite a special evening and then turned into a little bit like a seasonal outdoor music series. That particular form lasted about a year or so, or year or two, and then those friends, Daniella and Frank, moved away. I kind of continued on with that and just also, in organising projects that are bringing people together you also are exposing yourself, and getting into all kinds of new conversations and collaborations, and so my ideas moved into broader territories than just music. </span><span class="s1"> </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">It became food collaborations and ideas of building space or kind of creating more of an installation to support the gathering, and more just turning into these kind of open experiences, as opposed to just performance. So that just became its own little series of things that happened from 2006-2010 or so and then I also started getting a little more support from various institutions and things. I started to kind of do more institutional collaborations and it has evolved what that is, but always a strong instinct to get people together.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>jb:</strong> Is that something that you had to deal with a lot, when you were doing these gatherings, like with like police complaining, neighbours complaining, </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv: </strong>This is America</span><span class="s1"> </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>dw:</strong> Yeah, which is interesting, and a lot of the designs for organising this kind of came from this funny "what can you get away with" mentality, and it's almost like since there's not like a space that's readily being offered, you have to kind of take it. Even if the taking is kind of a very gentle taking of it, like singing a song with some people (it's not like a hard effect on a space), still you're compromising some rules. So yeah, there was definitely occasions when we would encounter some authority.</span><span class="s1"> </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> Are you cognisant of the privilege that it requires to do this kind of work?</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>dw:</strong> As space becomes more of a challenge for everyone—having had enough privilege like you said, to even think that you're able to do something, to be able to navigate a police conversation safely, is—is a privilege.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"> </span><span class="s1"><strong>jb:</strong> Where does 'ribbons' come from?</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>dw:</strong> The name specifically came from a conversation with my friend Frank in a very 24-year old, 25-year-old instinct to name things, it's like ‘a project should have a name’ kind of conversation, so the word 'ribbons', if I'm being honest, came from a conversation about farts, about how we like, </span><span class="s1"> </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">[fart-like machine sound]</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>jb:</strong> Is that my phone? That was my phone!</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>dw:</strong> An apt timing!</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv: </strong>So wait, how does ribbons and farts...</span><span class="s1"> </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>dw:</strong> So it's again, kind of embarrassing, kind of just what it is, but basically we were having a conversation about how we visualise farts and my friend was saying he had like a cloud kind of metaphor and I was like, well, it's like ribbons, when you walk, like a trail, you can walk around...we kind of joked about that. Anyway, we quickly let go of that first reference point but that, if I have to be honest, is how that name came. </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">But I found that it's a very nice name because it’s a name that allows for multiple associations, especially gathering projects or organising projects that are inherently collaborative, leaving it open to all kinds of people. I think there's something nice about the idea of being wrapped in ribbon, even if, hopefully it's not a fart ribbon. I hope that's not the effect.</span><span class="s1"> </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">[musical interlude]</span><span class="s1"> </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">OK, to see some examples of these events, look at www.davidwilsonandribbons.com </span><span class="s1"> </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> Wow, welcome back from David Wilson's studio in Oakland.
