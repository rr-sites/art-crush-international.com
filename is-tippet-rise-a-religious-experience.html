                in making ecstatic experiences for others. Would you like to be
                surrounded by rugged mountains, transported from one large-scale
                contemporary artwork to another in a free, solar-powered van
                while they charge your phone for you? How about being driven
                around by a sweet Frenchman who waxes poetic about his life’s
                work in a dusty pick-up truck? How about some gourmet
                locally-sourced food and a concert pianist? And some cows? This
                week, we’ve got it all.</span

                their work is small by necessity. It fits into storage lockers
                or on the walls of their buyers, to be sold at craft fairs. But

                of money happen to be artists. When this happens, it's kind of
                amazing. Because when artists have money, they don't stop
                working, they don't retire early. They keep making their work.

                did too really and that's I guess the, the breeding ground of
                transcendentalism and Emmersonianism and Thoreau—Walden,
                Whitman, all of that and to me that kind of brisk morning, those
                variegated coloured hills struck me as the intellectual
                chrysalis of America and the values that I believe, values that
                we are in danger of losing in our country but the Northeast has
                closed down a bit it's not quite the open land that it was when
                I went to school and when we grew up there and so I think we
                were looking to find that same intellectual quality of open
                space somewhere else and so that's why why we looked to Montana
                because even Colorado the space we could see, so much space was
                going to developments and even though you could buy a ranch,
                even though you could buy a large ranch, in Colorado, you
                weren't entirely sure that the land around you wouldn't be a
                development in 10 years.</span
