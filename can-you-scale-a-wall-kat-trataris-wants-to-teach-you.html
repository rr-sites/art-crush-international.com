                Powell Station and walked up the Tenderloin to get to rsf, which
                is Kat’s studio and gallery. And although I had the address we
                walked right past it and we had to turn around and I was
                embarrassed, but Jozefien was very forgiving.</span

                ><strong>jb:</strong> I went to the bathroom. The bathroom was
                really nicely decorated, there where like these white tiles and
                this black cement in between them. Then there were, I remember
                gold, golden objects, there were newspapers next to the toilet
                so you could read if you wanted to and I also remember this
                pinkish-reddish light, so, it was kind of an LA feeling I got
                there or a very artistic, very very modern, a little bit
                alienating.</span

                gallery from up here. It's a pretty dynamic space the way it’s
                been set up and so it's kind of it's a really fun space to work
                with. This is actually me and my friend Caitlin in

                studio, which she shares with another artist named Kaitlin.
                They've been friends for 7 years. They provided like drinks and
                there were snacks for us, so, that was really cool, so we could
                snack. And maybe I should mention that Kat was wearing an
                eyepatch and it looked great! Excellent ART CRUSH action
                there.</span

                swollen and this was morning and it's like super swollen and I
                was, like, whatever I'm just going to deal with it later, but as

                tooth if I didn’t need it and then I also liked grills, but that
                seemed inappropriate, and so, I settled on the tooth gem.</span

                bunk bed, on the top bunk, with two other women with the guy in
                the room next to us, like, in this really small basement garage
                room place. We kind of had one window and it was like under a
                family in the outermost Sunset, in sort of an alleyway with a
                shitty bar. There was like rats in our walls, but I paid $300

                $400, that’s how I moved here, so, that worked out pretty well.
                I had a studio, at a place called Earth Explosion the mission. I
                have always been really obsessed with getting a studio, even if
                I couldn’t afford it. I am very messy, I don't want to put it
                away and I don't like living with that stuff either. So, for,
                this works pretty well because I can do stuff with the gallery
                and come to my studio and do things here.</span

                downtown San Francisco, so it's pretty good. And, I do a lot of
                off-site work these days, I have been like doing clay stuff
                somewhere else, I've been doing wood things at work ‘cause we
                have a wood shop which I can use, it’s *** incredible. So, this
                is kind of, more like a thinking-assembling place anyway.</span

                experimentation or curatorial experimentation. And, we haven't
                had as much time to put into it lately as we wanted to because
                of just running the gallery by itself, but that is like a thing
                we want to call… We wanted to figure out a name and everyone
                calls us art mom, because we're just moming people, I guess, and
                the art world in general. And then, we like bought a minivan to
                move a bunch of art and then it got really out of control. I’m

                It's kind of hard. You just want to be cool and then you fail at
                it and it's fine and then you're just cool and elusive, because
                no one knows what it means, just like, we have no sign because
                we haven't been able to afford one and apparently people think
                it's a cool thing, so.</span

                like drawn all over stuff, they were one of my bad guys. I have
                three three bad guys in my narrative: the ants, the mould and
                the power outlets are the bad guys. So, they’re anything that
                comes from the outside in and disturb, like, the peace or the
                safety of household consumption.</span

                try and block them out, you can build more walls, better systems
                or put drugs down whatever, they still get in. So, they’re
                always, like, they're my resistance basically. They’re kind of
                an existential creature, which I didn't fully understand until I
                became like hyper obsessed with them recently.</span

                your process, things that are fresh and have these, like, time
                frames on them and we don’t, we don't like being restrained by
                time and also, I had an experience in high school where black
                mould grew in my room and gave me asthma for, like, a number of
                years, like, ruined my whole athletic career, basically,

                then…the outlets are not so much bad guys, I call them
                soothsayers. Like, there's an action of connecting something
                that comes from the outside to the inside that you're like
                reliant, dependent on, like, electrical umbilical cord, you
                know, and if you look at them they look and horrified, all the

                such a weird different ways. There’s certain things that I’ve
                parsed out through conversation with people about ways that I
                experience things differently. I don't even know what the word
                is, but like, every time someone says any words when there's any
                descriptors in it I imagine the thing playing out in my brain

                have, like, I have bad I eye sight. My ability to, like,
                navigate space is pretty weird, I have had to learn how to

                bodies, there's this artist, Maria Guzman Capron, she makes
                these like amazing quilted female figures that are turning into
                or out, coming out of landscapes and stuff, and they’re like
                tons of found fabrics that she paints or alters a little bit and
                they’re quilted together and they're oftentimes relating to,
                like, what does it mean to be a woman body that ages or is an
                immigrant or is non white or, like, has a difference to it and
                how is that body kind of always shifting and changing and how
                does it become re-empowered.</span

                are sometimes like half animal or landscape and they have these,
                like, a leg that's turning into a waterfall. It's kind of, kind
                of crazy to try to imagine it but, it's all quilted and then
                she'll do a lot of sculptural pieces too with, like, found
                objects or even ceramics that look like found objects, so she
                made them and they almost like reference *** she’s seen in a
